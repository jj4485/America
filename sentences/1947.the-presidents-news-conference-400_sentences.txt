Sentence 1: 1947 The Presidents News Conference 400

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have some rather lengthy statements to make to you this morning, and I have just asked Mr. Merriman Smith not to say "Thank you, Mr. President," too quickly.
Sentence 3: I didn't want anyone to think that I want to avoid any questions you want to ask.
Sentence 4: [1.]
Sentence 5: The first announcement I have to make is Arthur S. Barrows of Illinois to be Under Secretary for Air.
Sentence 6: Eugene M. Zuckert of Connecticut and Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney of New York to be Assistant Secretaries for Air.
Sentence 7: Gen. Carl Spaatz will be Chief of Staff.
Sentence 8: Dr. Vannevar Bush has been appointed Chairman of the Research and Development Board.
Sentence 9: And there is a letter--mimeographed letter from me that will be available for you when you go out.
Sentence 10: [2.]
Sentence 11: I am calling a meeting of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government for 11 o'clock on Monday the 29th.
Sentence 12: [3.]
Sentence 13: And now I have got a couple of rather long statements here, which I hope you will bear with me while I read them: one on food and one on the Marshall plan.
Sentence 14: Q. Mimeographed, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 15: All mimeographed.
Sentence 16: Everything is available in mimeographed form so that you can get it all written down, but I want you to hear it because it's right important.
Sentence 17: [Reading].
Sentence 18: "I am making public today a report from the Cabinet Committee on World Food Programs which emphasizes a critical situation calling for immediate action by every American.
Sentence 19: 1
The report stresses the extremely grave food situation abroad and the relationship between our ability to help meet urgent foreign food needs and the price situation in the United States.
Sentence 20: 1
The 5-page mimeographed report dated September 22, with letter of transmittal of the same date, was released by the White House later in the day.
Sentence 21: Also released was the text of a letter, dated September 24, summarizing the Committee's recommendations.
Sentence 22: "The Committee states that adverse crop developments, including those of recent weeks, both in North America and in Europe, make apparent a food shortage even worse than a year ago.
Sentence 23: The losses from heavy frosts in northwestern Europe last winter have been increased by a general European drought this spring and summer.
Sentence 24: Any significant cut in the already low rations in those countries will have most serious consequences for their rehabilitation.
Sentence 25: "In the face of this situation, the report shows that, without further action, we would be able to carry through a large export program; but, as a result of sharply reduced corn production and continued high domestic demand for grain, exports would not equal last year's total shipments--even though world needs are greater.
Sentence 26: "The United States cannot rest on this export prospect.
Sentence 27: To ship more abroad without adjustments in domestic demand, however, would aggravate our own price situation.
Sentence 28: "In presenting their report, the Cabinet Committee stressed the urgency of doing everything possible to meet the problem at home and abroad.
Sentence 29: It recommended further emphasis on shipments of food other than grain in rounding out our export program, and on arrangements for the fullest participation by other nations in the combined effort to increase available supplies and to channel them to points of greatest need.
Sentence 30: "The Committee made it clear, however, that definite steps to conserve on use of foodstuffs at home and reduce the feeding of grain to livestock will be essential if we are to make our fullest contribution towards meeting minimum foreign needs and at the same time relieve the upward pressure on prices at home.
Sentence 31: "As a primary step, I am therefore appointing a Citizens Food Committee to advise on ways and means of carrying out the necessary conservation effort.
Sentence 32: Charles Luckman of Cambridge, Mass., will serve as chairman of this nonpartisan committee.
Sentence 33: I am asking the Citizens Food Committee to meet at the earliest possible moment to develop plans for bringing the vital problem of food conservation to the attention of every American for action.
Sentence 34: 1
1
The President's telegram to those invited to serve on the Committee announced that the first meeting would be held at the White House on October 1 at 10 a.m. (see Item 198).
Sentence 35: The telegram, dated September 25, was released by the White House on September 26.
Sentence 36: "At the same time, I am establishing a working organization which will mobilize the resources of the Government in support of the overall program.
Sentence 37: I will also confer with the congressional leaders of both parties regarding legislative action which may be necessary.
Sentence 38: "While waiting for detailed recommendations from the Citizens Committee, there is one immediate and personal thing each of us can do.
Sentence 39: We can start now to conserve by being more selective in foods we buy, particularly livestock products whose production requires large quantities of grain.
Sentence 40: Such action on our part will do two things.
Sentence 41: We will save on our family budget and we will help others who are in desperate need.
Sentence 42: I am confident that the American people, realizing the extreme seriousness of the situation, will fully cooperate.
Sentence 43: "
Here is a list of the committee:
Charles Luckman, President of Lever Brothers, Cambridge, Mass., is chairman.
Sentence 44: These other people have been asked to serve.

Sentence 62: [Reading].
Sentence 63: "The Secretary of State has transmitted to me the official report of the Committee of European Economic Cooperation"--that's it right there
Sentence 64: [indicating on his desk] for anybody who wants to read it--"prepared by the representatives of the 16 nations who have been meeting in Paris since early July.
Sentence 65: 1
At my request, Secretary Marshall is sending a message to the Chairman of the Committee, Foreign Minister Bevin, acknowledging receipt of the report by the United States Government.
Sentence 66: 1
The report dated September 21, 1947, is printed in two volumes "General Report," 138 pp., and "Technical Reports," 552 pp.
Sentence 67: (Government Printing Office).
Sentence 68: "As the document itself states, it is an 'initial report,' and is subject to review and revision.
Sentence 69: Nonetheless, it reflects an unprecedented effort at economic cooperation by the 16 countries participating in the Paris Conference.
Sentence 70: In the light of the political tensions and the economic instability in Europe, it is an important and encouraging first step that these nations had the initiative and the determination to meet together and produce this report.
Sentence 71: "The problem to which this report is addressed not only underlies the political and economic well-being of Europe but is also of key importance to a stable peace in the world.
Sentence 72: The people of the United States recognize, as do the people of the European nations, that the earliest practicable achievement of economic health, and consequent political stability in Europe, is of utmost importance for the peace and well-being of the world.
Sentence 73: "I note that the program presented in the report is based on the 4 following lines of action by the 16 European nations: (1) a strong productive effort on their part; (2) creation of internal financial stability; (3) maximum cooperation among the participating countries; and (4) a solution to the trading deficit with the American Continent, particularly by exports.
Sentence 74: These are sound principles and will appeal to the commonsense of the American people.
Sentence 75: Their effective translation into practice is vital both to European recovery and to worldwide economic health.
Sentence 76: "While the 16-nation committee has been meeting in Paris, the United States Government has been proceeding with complementary studies on this side of the Atlantic.
Sentence 77: "Last June I appointed three committees to study the relationship between aid which may be extended to foreign countries and the interests of our domestic economy.
Sentence 78: One of these, headed by the Secretary of the Interior, has been making a study of the state of our natural resources.
Sentence 79: Another of these studies, relating to the impact on our national economy of aid to other countries, is being conducted by the Council of Economic Advisers.
Sentence 80: The third group, a nonpartisan committee of distinguished citizens under the chairmanship of the Secretary of Commerce, was requested to determine the character and quantities of United States resources available for assistance to foreign countries and to advise the President on the limits within which the United States may safely and wisely plan to extend such assistance."
Sentence 81: Each one of these agencies will receive a copy of the European Report.
Sentence 82: "Other agencies of the executive branch of the Government have also been considering the role which should be played by the United States in European recovery.
Sentence 83: "The great interest of the Congress in this subject has been demonstrated by the number of its Members whom it has sent abroad to study prevailing conditions at first hand.
Sentence 84: "We shall need to consult with representatives of the European Committee to obtain clarification and amplification of the initial report and to obtain further information, as it becomes available, as to the specific measures to be adopted by the participating countries in carrying out the principles set forth in the report.
Sentence 85: "I am requesting the special committees which I appointed and other Government agencies to appraise the information received from the European Committee in the light of the studies they have conducted.
Sentence 86: The results of this appraisal will be made available to the appropriate congressional committees.
Sentence 87: "On the basis of these studies, which will go forward without delay, the facts will be presented and recommendations will be formulated so that the American people through their representatives in Congress can determine to what extent and in what manner the resources of the United States may be brought to the support of the renewed European efforts to achieve sustained economic recovery.
Sentence 88: When the American people are satisfied as to the scope of the necessary program and the sufficiency of measures of self-help and mutual help being taken by the European countries, and when we can determine what resources we should and can wisely make available, I am sure that we shall respond as quickly as possible.
Sentence 89: "Meanwhile, certain problems have arisen in connection with the economic situation in Europe that are of such an urgent nature that their solution cannot await the careful study required for the overall decisions which will be based on the reports.
Sentence 90: These problems are of an emergency nature which demand immediate attention.
Sentence 91: "It is for this reason that I have requested a group.
Sentence 92: of congressional leaders
Sentence 93: to meet with me on Monday, September 29th, to discuss plans for determining the action to be taken by the United States to aid in preserving the stability and promoting the recovery of the nations which participated in the Paris Conference.
Sentence 94: "
I am sorry that those things have to be so long, and that they had to be read, too, but they had to be specifically--state specifically what is meant.
Sentence 95: Those statements tell exactly what they mean, and the copies I have got show.
Sentence 96: Now if you want to ask any questions, I will try to answer them.
Sentence 97: [5.]
Sentence 98: Q. Mr. President, on your food statement, do we understand it correctly that you are asking the American people to eat less for the time being?
Sentence 99: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: I am asking the American people to waste less for the time being.
Sentence 101: I was informed by one of the biggest restaurant men in the United States, just the other night, that one slice of bread would meet this wheat shortage.
Sentence 102: Q. Mr. President, have you had any special offer of cooperation from the baking industry?
Sentence 103: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: We expect to get it.
Sentence 105: They have promised it.
Sentence 106: Q. Mr. President, is there any prospect of a return to so-called gray bread?
Sentence 107: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: I don't know.
Sentence 109: That is what I have called this committee in for, to find out just how we stand to meet the situation.
Sentence 110: Q. Is there any prospect of a return to rationing or price control?
Sentence 111: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 112: Well now, you had better ask the Congress that.
Sentence 113: I can't answer that question.
Sentence 114: [6.]
Sentence 115: Q. Does this plan of yours--what you said there--does that throw out the window a special or extra session of Congress, or reconvening of Congress?
Sentence 116: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: The question was whether this threw out the possibility of an extra session of Congress.
Sentence 118: The meeting with the congressional leaders on Monday morning is to discuss the situation.
Sentence 119: Then I will make the announcement after we have had the conversations with them.
Sentence 120: [7.]
Sentence 121: Q. Mr. President, you said one slice of bread would lick the wheat problem.
Sentence 122: Do you mean if everyone in the country would eat one slice less ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 123: If they would save the bread that they throw away--this is what this restaurant man told me--we would have, I think, 70 million more bushels of wheat available for food.
Sentence 124: Q. 70 million, did you say?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 125: That's what the head of the packing mill industry told me, also.
Sentence 126: Q. 17 or 70?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 127: 70.
Sentence 128: [8.]
Sentence 129: Q. Mr. President, does this stopgap relief you are talking about fall in the same category as more permanent relief?
Sentence 130: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: NO it does not.
Sentence 132: Q. In other words, you might conceivably work it out without a special session of Congress ?
Sentence 133: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 134: That is exactly what we are trying to do.
Sentence 135: I don't know whether we can or not.
Sentence 136: That is the reason I have called this committee in, to see just exactly what we can do.
Sentence 137: Q.
Sentence 138: Do you know how many millions of dollars are involved in this stopgap relief ?
Sentence 139: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 140: I can't say.
Sentence 141: I can't say.
Sentence 142: Q.
Sentence 143: But you said you are trying to work out the stopgap relief problem without a special session ?
Sentence 144: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: Yes.
Sentence 146: That's right.
Sentence 147: Q. Have you had any indication yet as to about how many congressional leaders will be able to come on Monday?
Sentence 148: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 149: The customary number.
Sentence 150: The ones that have always been asked--the Big Six and the heads of the minorities and the ranking members of the Appropriations and the Foreign Relations Committees.
Sentence 151: I will give you the list of those that have accepted as soon as we have heard from them.
Sentence 152: Q, Mr. President, would that stopgap aid be on the Marshall plan or the food situation?
Sentence 153: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 154: It is the food situation.
Sentence 155: It is the food situation.
Sentence 156: There are certain countries in Europe that are scraping the bottom of the barrel on food and fuel.
Sentence 157: And nobody is going to let people starve to death or freeze to death, if we can possibly stop that from happening.
Sentence 158: Q. Mr. President, you said rationing was up to Congress.
Sentence 159: Will you recommend rationing?
Sentence 160: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 161: I will wait and see whether it is necessary or not.
Sentence 162: I have to get the stuff myself yet.
Sentence 163: That is what I called this committee in for.
Sentence 164: [9.]
Sentence 165: Q. Mr. President, have you any reflections on where the responsibility or origination of the present high cost of living lies?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 166: Well, I am not going to get into controversial questions this morning.
Sentence 167: I will answer that when I make any political speeches, which won't be very soon.
Sentence 168: You can work that out just as well as I can.
Sentence 169: [Laughter]
Sentence 170: [10.]
Sentence 171: Q. Mr. President, do you have any inclination yourself, one way or the other, regarding a special session of Congress?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 172: NO I haven't.
Sentence 173: As I told you before this, I can be convinced if it is necessary--open mind on the subject.
Sentence 174: [11.]
Sentence 175: Q. Mr. President, what is the nature of the legislative action you refer to in your statement on food?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 176: The money that is necessary to get it with.
Sentence 177: Q. Is there any consideration of reenactment of wartime controls which permit you to set aside
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 178: That is a matter that we are going to discuss.
Sentence 179: I don't think there is any possibility of its being done, but it may be necessary.
Sentence 180: I don't know.
Sentence 181: What is Mr. Wright's question?
Sentence 182: You have been trying to ask me a question for a half hour.
Sentence 183: James L. Wright, Buffalo Evening News:
Sentence 184: Yes, and now I have forgotten what it was.
Sentence 185: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 186: I'm sorry.
Sentence 187: [12.]
Sentence 188: Q. Mr. President, there is the suggestion that there be two meatless days a week, something of that sort.
Sentence 189: Have you any recommendations on that?
Sentence 190: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 191: That is a matter I am going to discuss with this special committee that I am calling, for the purpose of looking into the whole situation, to see what is necessary to be done.
Sentence 192: What is necessary to be done I will tell you about it frankly.
Sentence 193: Q.
Sentence 194: In our house we are already having two meatless days.
Sentence 195: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 196: I appreciate it.
Sentence 197: [13.]
Sentence 198: Q. Mr. President, you specifically said that this immediate critical problem is one of food and fuel.
Sentence 199: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 200: That's right.
Sentence 201: Q.
Sentence 202: The dollar shortage is not concerned in any way ?
Sentence 203: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 204: Of course the dollar shortage has caused the shortage of food and fuel.
Sentence 205: They haven't got the money to buy it with.
Sentence 206: Q. Then have you any estimate, sir, on how much
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 207: I have not.
Sentence 208: [14.]
Sentence 209: Mr. Wright: Mr. President, my inquiry comes back to me.
Sentence 210: Q. On the Latin American contribution
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 211: I am going to get Mr. Wright's question, and then I will answer yours.
Sentence 212: Mr. Wright: All right.
Sentence 213: There has been quite a bit of point made by various Republicans-Martin, for example, and Vandenberg, to a certain extent--that they haven't the information that convinces you that this is an emergency proposition.
Sentence 214: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 215: I am giving them the information just as quickly as I get it myself.
Sentence 216: I began receiving administrative--the reports on the battleship Missouri, and it was finally handed to me last Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, and up to now.
Sentence 217: And this--[indicating reports before him I--is the last thing in connection with it, which just came in this morning.
Sentence 218: I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
Sentence 219: As soon as all that information is coordinated, every one of those fellows will be informed, just the same as I am.
Sentence 220: Q.
Sentence 221: I see.
Sentence 222: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 223: That is what the Secretary of State is getting up for me now.
Sentence 224: Q.
Sentence 225: The Speaker made the point that private sources of information were that there is not a desperate situation now, that they can wait over until the first of January.
Sentence 226: THE PRESIDENT, I remember Senator Borah made a speech like that once.
Sentence 227: What was your question there?
Sentence 228: [15.]
Sentence 229: Q. I wonder if you could comment on the Latin American contribution of approximately ....
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 230: We hope the Latin American countries will come in.
Sentence 231: It is necessary that they do come in, if we are going to meet this situation as it should be met.
Sentence 232: Q. Would this program rule out the possibility of tax reduction next year?
Sentence 233: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 234: I will answer that the first of January in the Message on the State of the Union.
Sentence 235: [16.]
Sentence 236: Q. Yesterday, sir, Senator Flanders telegraphed you asking that you use your administrative powers to curb grain speculation.
Sentence 237: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 238: I only saw the telegram in the paper.
Sentence 239: I haven't received any such telegram.
Sentence 240: What was your question?
Sentence 241: [17.]
Sentence 242: Q. Would you care to comment on the trend of events in U.N., specifically the trend indicated by Mr. Vishinsky's speech?
Sentence 243: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 244: Mr. Vishinsky's speech speaks for itself, and I have no comment to make on it.
Sentence 245: [18.]
Sentence 246: Q. Mr. President, is any conference planned with the Latin American countries regarding what part they can take in the Marshall plan?
Sentence 247: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 248: There will be.
Sentence 249: Q. There will be?
Sentence 250: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 251: Yes.
Sentence 252: [19.]
Sentence 253: Q. Mr. President, does the Spaatz announcement infer that Bradley will go back to the Veterans Bureau?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 254: I will answer that question a little later.
Sentence 255: [20.]
Sentence 256: Q. Mr. President, pardon me, sir, is it--is this conference already scheduled with the Latin American countries regarding
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 257: NO, but they will be consulted right along with the rest of the world.
Sentence 258: Everybody that has anything that is surplus, that will feed and keep people from starving, we are going to try to get it.
Sentence 259: Q.
Sentence 260: You don't mean a formal conference like Rio or -
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 261: No, no.
Sentence 262: No.
Sentence 263: Consultation is what it amounts to.
Sentence 264: [21.]
Sentence 265: Q. Stopgap relief be in addition to the Marshall plan?
Sentence 266: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 267: Yes.
Sentence 268: [22.]
Sentence 269: Q. Mr. President, you didn't mean Spaatz is going to be Chief of Staff of the Army?
Sentence 270: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 272: [23.]
Sentence 273: Q. Mr. President, are you going to the world series?
Sentence 274: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 275: I am not.
Sentence 276: Q.
Sentence 277: You are not.
Sentence 278: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 279: I would like very much to go, but I have got too much to do right here on this desk.
Sentence 280: I have got to stay here whether I want to or not.
Sentence 281: Q. Watch it by television, Mr. President.
Sentence 282: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 283: I will, if they do have television over here, try to see one or two of the games, if it doesn't take me too long away from the desk.
Sentence 284: [24.]
Sentence 285: Q.
Sentence 286: If the program means voluntary rationing, doesn't that mean that people with money and without conscience get all the food ?
Sentence 287: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 288: I don't know, I hope that that isn't the case.
Sentence 289: I certainly hope that that isn't the case.
Sentence 290: I don't like to think that there are Americans with all the money who would want to see people starve for their benefit.
Sentence 291: I don't believe there are any such people in this country.
Sentence 292: Q.
Sentence 293: We had a black market here during rationing.
Sentence 294: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 295: I know that, but that was a very small minority.
Sentence 296: I think I have told you before that I think at least 95 percent of the people want to do the fight thing, and all our troubles are caused by the 5 percent.
Sentence 297: That is true here, too!
Sentence 298: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, do you conclude that you have proposed a program of voluntary rationing?
Sentence 299: THE PRESIDENT, I will answer that question when I have had the meeting with the committee.
Sentence 300: Q.
Sentence 301: Your proposal this morning
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 302: The proposal is to waste less, and see if we can't meet this situation.
Sentence 303: That is the beginning of the problem.
Sentence 304: Then we are going to work it out on a practical basis, which will be handled right here from this office.
Sentence 305: Reporter:
Sentence 306: Thank you, Mr. President.
