Sentence 1: 1946 The Presidents News Conference 428

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I want to read a couple of things to you, and then I will stand for questions as usual.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: "Judge Samuel I. Rosenman is leaving the White House officially on February 1st, to return to private life in New York City.
Sentence 5: I make this announcement with deep regret.
Sentence 6: "
You will receive copies of this.
Sentence 7: It is mimeographed, so you don't have to take it down now.
Sentence 8: [Continuing reading]: "Judge Rosenman sought to resign in a letter to me dated April 14, 1945.
Sentence 9: I told him I could not let him go, and he patriotically accepted my decision.
Sentence 10: In justice to him, I can no longer try to dissuade him from leaving.
Sentence 11: "Judge Rosenman's service to two Presidents, and to his country, has been as able and as devoted as it has been self-effacing.
Sentence 12: I wrote him June 1st last, 'Some day, when accurate history is written, you will receive the credit which is your due.'
Sentence 13: To that expression I now add that the months since then have materially swollen the account.
Sentence 14: "The work for which Judge Rosenman resigned from the Supreme Court of the State of New York in October 1943, at the request of President Roosevelt, was essentially a war job.
Sentence 15: Although he had been rendering regular part-time war service in Washington before that, the needs of the war eventually required that his full time be spent in the White House.
Sentence 16: Now that our enemies have surrendered and he has resigned, I have decided that this wartime emergency post should not be filled.
Sentence 17: Accordingly, no successor will be appointed to the place vacated by Judge Rosenman as Special Counsel to the President.
Sentence 18: "Judge Rosenman, however, has agreed to come to Washington from time to time, without compensation, to continue to render whatever assistance and advice to me he can.
Sentence 19: I expect to call on him frequently for help, as did President Roosevelt during his tenure of office.
Sentence 20: "
Where is the Judge?
Sentence 21: I will give this to him.
Sentence 22: Judge Rosenman: Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Sentence 23: [2.]
Sentence 24: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: Now, there has been some conversation, in fact quite a tempest in a teapot, over an addition to the office space of the President of the United States.
Sentence 26: [Laughter]
I want to clarify the situation, if possible, and then if some of our good friends want to come down and chain themselves to a bush or a shrub out here, that will be entirely satisfactory, just as the ladies did when they were building the Jefferson Memorial.
Sentence 27: Some ladies chained themselves to some Japanese cherry trees, you remember.
Sentence 28: [Laughter]
[Reading, not literally]: "The new office addition is an extension of 145 feet--145 feet long and 50 feet wide, extending along the West Executive Avenue, south of the existing Executive Office.
Sentence 29: It will not be visible from Pennsylvania Avenue, and very little, if any, from the White House.
Sentence 30: The auditorium will be south of the Executive Office and east of the new addition, and it will be 51 feet by 54 feet in size.
Sentence 31: "This new addition will not be visible to the public view, except from the air and from the Executive Avenue--[indicating]out here where it faces.
Sentence 32: "The present actual office space of the President is 17,566 square feet.
Sentence 33: The new office space will be 13,672 square feet.
Sentence 34: "The White House will not be changed or altered in any manner, interior or exterior."
Sentence 35: "To the President of the United States: "The Members of the Commission on fine Arts were delighted to review with you on November 30 preliminary plans prepared by Mr. L. S. Winslow for additions to the West Wing of the White House, necessary to provide additional space for the more efficient functioning of the Executive Offices of the President.
Sentence 36: "
A great many of the clerks have to work underground now, and I am not going to allow that to continue.
Sentence 37: And I am also trying to get business offices out of the White House so that the President can have a residence, which is what the White House is intended to be.
Sentence 38: [Continuing reading]: "The Commission are pleased to advise that they find the plans generally satisfactory, and approve them, subject to further study of certain details of the design by the architect.
Sentence 39: Mr. Winslow has agreed to confer with the Commission, from time to time, as the more detailed plans are developed.
Sentence 40: The Commission were pleased to note that the further extension of the West Wing to the South will not seriously encroach upon the grounds of the White House, in fact that the nature of the proposed extension of the West Wing will serve to provide the grounds near the House with greater seclusion than has been possible heretofore.
Sentence 41: The Commission are especially pleased to be called upon to advise in this matter, with the view toward retaining in this new structure the dignity and the charm which obtains in the case of the White House in the existing Wings in the East and the West.
Sentence 42: "
That is signed by the Chairman of the Commission.
Sentence 43: Now, under the date of December 12, I wrote a letter to the President of the Senate, and sent a letter to the Director of the Budget, containing an estimate for supplemental appropriation for an addition to the Executive Office for alterations, improvements, and furnishings, and for improvement of the grounds, to be expended as the President may determine.
Sentence 44: Now the White House has had no improvements, no paint or anything else done to it during the wartime; in fact, very little repair has been made to the White House in the last 16 years, due to things that were much more important to be done.
Sentence 45: I think the White House is the finest residence in the United States, and I want to keep it that way.
Sentence 46: There are certain improvements that have been pending by the fine Arts Commission and by the National Park and Planning Commission to the grounds which are necessary to be made.
Sentence 47: This additional office space is absolutely essential to the President.
Sentence 48: I don't want to have to do what Dolley Madison was supposed to have done.
Sentence 49: They say she used to hang her washing in the East Room on rainy days.
Sentence 50: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 51: That was Abigail Adams.
Sentence 52: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: I may have to move three clerks in there, if I can't find--
Q. Abigail Adams.
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: Dolley Madison, too.
Sentence 56: Abigail Adams or Dolley Madison did-both did it.
Sentence 57: So they say.
Sentence 58: That is just the story around here.
Sentence 59: Now, I have no further announcements to make, but I thought that ought to be made entirely clear to you.
Sentence 60: I want to make it plain that if anybody wants to chain himself to a bush out here, he is welcome.
Sentence 61: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, that is an appropriation by Congress, is it not?
Sentence 62: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: Yes.
Sentence 64: Through the regular channels.
Q.
Sentence 65: The story that it can be stopped by Congress is a little bit of hooey, I should imagine?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: Well, I don't think there are any Congressmen interested in--in the thing who are familiar with it, but they can get headlines in Washington papers by talking about it.
Sentence 67: Q. Congress had a chance to--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 68: Congress passed on it.
Sentence 69: Yes, everything is regular, and has been followed in the regular way.
Sentence 70: And the White House will not be hurt.
Sentence 71: [3.]
Sentence 72: Q. Mr. President, what do you-what is your reaction to the suggestion last night by Benjamin Fairless, that you call a conference of management executives involved in current strikes?
Sentence 73: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: Well, I have had conferences with management executives interested in current strikes.
Sentence 75: I am perfectly willing to have other conferences, but I don't make appointments over the radio, or through the press.
Sentence 76: They can come in the regular way, and the door will be open.
Sentence 77: Now the best thing that Mr. Fairless can do now is to send me word, "I accept.
Sentence 78: "
Q. In that connection, three Senators are preparing a resolution--Senators Tunnell, Morse, and Kilgore--for an investigation of management in the situation, apparently looking to the proposal advanced by Mr. Murray that there might have been a business conspiracy.
Sentence 79: What do you think of such a resolution?
Sentence 80: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: I don't know anything about that situation, and I knew nothing about the resolution.
Sentence 82: That is a matter for the Congress to decide itself.
Sentence 83: Q. Have you received any evidence that might support the Murray thesis that there was conspiracy by some big business men against the unions, in this situation?
Sentence 84: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 85: No, I haven't.
Sentence 86: I think this is really a tryout of power.
Sentence 87: I personally think there is too much power on each side, and I think it is necessary that the Government assert the fact that it is the power of the people.
Sentence 88: [4.]
Sentence 89: Q. Mr. President, since your last press conference, there has been quite a bit of discussion in and out of Congress on the trusteeship issue.
Sentence 90: I asked Mr. Ross to give you some questions.
Sentence 91: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: He gave me those questions, and they are detail questions, which I cannot answer now, because it requires negotiation with our allies and negotiation through the United Nations to accomplish the necessary purpose which we have in view.
Sentence 93: I can say definitely, however, that the national defense necessities of the United States will not be sacrificed.
Sentence 94: [5.]
Sentence 95: Q. Mr. President, Mr. Fairless also said that a high official of the Government told him that if he would accept, that a rise of $4 a ton would be granted.
Sentence 96: Can you explain what he meant by that?
Sentence 97: THE PRESIDENT, NO, I can't.
Sentence 98: I am not the high official, and I talked to him.
Sentence 99: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, to use your own words, what are the plans of the Government to assert itself in the steel strike?
Sentence 100: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: We are doing everything we possibly can on the subject, and have--I think I have done everything I possibly could to get a settlement of the steel strike.
Sentence 102: As I told you a while ago, I think there is a desire on each side to make known which is the power.
Sentence 103: Now I don't think that is in the public interest at all.
Sentence 104: I think it is in the public interest for the workers to go back to work, and I think it is in the public interest for big steel to settle this strike on the basis which I suggested to them.
Sentence 105: Q. Mr. President, are you suggesting that the workers go back to work without an increase?
Sentence 106: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: I am suggesting that the workers go back to work on the increase which I suggested.
Sentence 108: Q. Mr. President, you said that it was time--indicated that it was time the Government assert the fact that it is the power of the people, and you also said that you have done everything you can.
Sentence 109: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 110: I have.
Sentence 111: I have asked Congress for certain improvements in the situation, which the Congress has not seen fit to give me.
Sentence 112: You see, we have divided powers in the Government, which is a good thing.
Sentence 113: It requires diffused powers.
Sentence 114: I don't like concentration of power anywhere, so it takes the action of the Congress and the President and the courts finally to implement our Government.
Sentence 115: And I think it is the greatest Government in the world.
Sentence 116: I am trying to make it that, right now.
Sentence 117: Q. Mr. President, if the strike is prolonged, will you seize the mills?
Sentence 118: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 119: I don't think it's practical to seize the steel mills at the present time.
Sentence 120: I don't say that I won't do it eventually.
Sentence 121: Q. Mr. President, how can the workers go back to work if the Corporation won't give them the increase?
Sentence 122: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 123: They can't.
Sentence 124: That is what I am saying to you.
Sentence 125: [6.]
Sentence 126: Q. Mr. President, in the case of the meat industry, we understand that the men are going back to work at the old wage?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 127: The men, I am sure, will obey the law.
Sentence 128: The law requires them to go back to work at the old wage.
Sentence 129: [7.]
Sentence 130: Q.
Sentence 131: If you seized the steel plants, they would have to go back--
THE PRESIDENT, That is correct.
Sentence 132: Q.--after the seizure?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 133: That is correct.
Sentence 134: [8.]
Sentence 135: Q. Mr. President, now that Mayor La Guardia is a radio commentator, has he submitted his resignation as Chairman of the Canadian-American Defense Board?
Sentence 136: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 137: I haven't received it as yet.
Sentence 138: I don't think I have.
Sentence 139: I have a drawer full of them.
Sentence 140: It may be among them.
Sentence 141: I haven't seen it.
Sentence 142: Q.
Sentence 143: Mr. La Guardia is coming in today.
Sentence 144: Will that be discussed?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: It will not.
Sentence 146: Mr. La Guardia is going as the Special Representative of the President of the United States to the inauguration of the President of Brazil.
Sentence 147: That is the subject he is going to talk to me about.
Sentence 148: [9.]
Sentence 149: Q. Mr. President, Phil Murray yesterday sent a letter to Secretary Vinson, outlining very large rebates from taxes to corporations, including steel companies.
Sentence 150: Have you gone into that?
Sentence 151: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 152: Yes, I have.
Sentence 153: Q. Is there any reply to it?
Sentence 154: HE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 155: None whatever.
Sentence 156: I didn't go into Mr. Murray's--I didn't know anything about Mr. Murray's letter, because I had that information on my own initiative, when I was trying to settle this thing.
Sentence 157: I know all about it, however, but I haven't seen Mr. Murray's letter.
Sentence 158: I know what the situation is.
Sentence 159: Q. Anything to be done about it--any suggestions?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 160: No.
Sentence 161: I have no suggestions to make.
Sentence 162: Q. Legislation?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 163: I made my suggestions to Mr. Fairless and Mr. Murray.
Sentence 164: [10.]
Sentence 165: Q. Mr. President, would you care to make any observations on the new National Intelligence Authority?
Sentence 166: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: Yes.
Sentence 168: I think it is a practical program, and that it will work for the best interests of the Government.
Sentence 169: It was a necessary arrangement, in order to have all the information available for all the people who need it in implementing foreign policy.
Sentence 170: It combines the intelligence services of the State, War, Navy, and the President, in a manner so that the information will be available to all four for the transaction of Government business.
Sentence 171: [11.]
Sentence 172: Q. Mr. President, is Hap Arnold quitting, and when?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 173: He was making this tour of South America prior to his retirement.
Sentence 174: He expected to retire as soon as he returned.
Sentence 175: Q.
Sentence 176: That will be about February 15?
Sentence 177: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 178: Yes, somewhere between the 1st and the 10th of February.
Sentence 179: But I think he is coming home ahead of schedule, because he is--he hasn't been feeling very well.
Sentence 180: [12.]
Sentence 181: Q. Is General Spaatz
Sentence 182: [pronouncing it Spats] going to take his place?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 183: General Spaatz
Sentence 184: [pronouncing it Spahts ].--
Q. Spaatz
Sentence 185: [Spahts] it is.
Sentence 186: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 187: --Will take his place.
Sentence 188: [13.]
Sentence 189: Q. Mr. President, going back to that Intelligence Authority for a minute, is that a revival of the OFF in general?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 190: No, it is not.
Sentence 191: It isn't.
Sentence 192: It isn't.
Sentence 193: Q. Mr. President, do you suppose, if we had such a setup back in 1940 or 1941, that there would not have been a Pearl Harbor?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 194: I can't say that it was a--contributing greatly towards its not taking place.
Sentence 195: I can't say whether there would have been a Pearl Harbor or not.
Sentence 196: You can make any "if" meet any situation.
Sentence 197: [14.]
Sentence 198: Q. May I revert to the steel strike?
Sentence 199: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 200: Certainly--certainly.
Q.
Sentence 201: There is an organization known as nonbasic steel producers headed up by a man named Evans--he heads a steel shop in Detroit--probably everybody's got it-they run 700 secondary plants or nonbasic plants, and they have this CIO union contract.
Sentence 202: In none of them is there any dispute with the men on wages, but they are all out.
Sentence 203: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 204: They ought to go back to work.
Sentence 205: They ought to go back to work.
Sentence 206: If there is no dispute, they ought to go back to work.
Sentence 207: We are trying to get everybody to work, so as to make this production work.
Sentence 208: Everybody that can, ought to go back.
Sentence 209: I have been preaching that ever since August 18.
Sentence 210: Q. Mr. President, do you think, if the steel strike is settled, that the General Motors strike will fall in line?
Sentence 211: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 212: I can't say whether it would or not, but that is--it is logical to conclude that that might happen.
Sentence 213: Q. Mr. President, do you plan to recommend any further legislation to labor such as beyond the fact-finding, if the strikes continue?
Sentence 214: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 215: No. I made that recommendation back December 3d, hoping to avert some of these things.
Sentence 216: [15.]
Sentence 217: Q. Mr. President, if we could return to the trusteeship question again, isn't the veto of the big powers significant in connection with the trusteeship question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 218: I think it will be, yes.
Sentence 219: [16.]
Sentence 220: Q. Mr. President, have Republicans suggested to you that there should be two Republicans on the Maritime Commission?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 221: No, they haven't; but that probably will be the case.
Sentence 222: I just appointed two Republicans day before yesterday.
Sentence 223: [17.]
Sentence 224: Q. Mr. President, from your experience in the Senate, have you any suggestions as to how the Senate can solve this problem of filibustering on the FEPC?
Sentence 225: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 226: For your information, I have been through several filibusters, and that is a matter that the Senate itself must settle without outside interference, especially from the President.
Sentence 227: [More laughter]
Q. Mr. President, have you ever taken a position on cloture?
Sentence 228: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 229: Yes.
Sentence 230: Well, all you have to do is to read the Record down there.
Sentence 231: I was always for cloture.
Sentence 232: No secret.
Sentence 233: [18.]
Sentence 234: Q. Mr. President, is the Anglo credit message going up shortly?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 235: Yes.
Sentence 236: Just as soon as we get it prepared, it will go up.
Sentence 237: [19.]
Sentence 238: Q. Mr. President, the morning papers report the Government has $1 billion worth of steel plants of its own which are now strike-bound.
Sentence 239: Why isn't the Government operating them?
Sentence 240: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 241: They are integrations of other plants, and principally--except the one at Provo, Utah.
Sentence 242: That one is a complete plant by itself, and we have under consideration the idea of operating it.
Sentence 243: [20.]
Sentence 244: Q. Mr. President, in connection with the new administration starting in office, will Brazil and the United States continue its good neighbor policy?
Sentence 245: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 246: Certainly.
Sentence 247: Brazil is our friend, and we are the friends of Brazil, and every other South American country
Q.
Sentence 248: [Interposing loudly]
Sentence 249: Thank you, Mr. President!
Sentence 250: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 251: --that will let us be friends with them.
Sentence 252: [More laughter]
Q.
Sentence 253: I was going to have a question!
Sentence 254: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 255: It's too late now!
