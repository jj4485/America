Sentence 1: 1937 Press Conference 19

THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 2: I think you have got all the news there is.
Sentence 3: I don't know of any, literally.
Sentence 4: Q. Do you care to amplify your remarks at Chicago, especially where you referred to a possible quarantine?
Sentence 5: THE PRESIDENT; No.
Q.
Sentence 6: Have you had any communication with Mr. Black since his return?
Sentence 7: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 8: None at all.
Sentence 9: Q. Did you have any prior knowledge of the fact that he was going to speak?
Sentence 10: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 11: I just might as well talk to you, off the record.
Sentence 12: Actually what happened that day was that in the morning, I think it was Jimmie who said, "By the way, Mr. Black is going on the air tonight at 6:30."
Sentence 13: I had entirely forgotten about it.
Sentence 14: I said, "Fine," and never thought about it again, and I did not go to the Governor's Mansion to receive a telephone call, Ernest [Lindley], and I did not change cars, U. P., because I wanted to avoid the radio.
Sentence 15: What happened was very simple.
Sentence 16: About twenty minutes before five, before we got into Olympia
Sentence 17: , the Governor said, "It has stopped raining.
Sentence 18: Don't you think it would be a good idea to get into the open car because there will be a crowd there?"
Sentence 19: When we got into Olympia there were certain reasons why we wanted to go to the Governor's Mansion—I need not explain any further—and after we got away from Olympia the road was wet
Sentence 20: so we slowed up the procession to prevent the policemen on motorcycles from going overboard.
Sentence 21: For that reason we had a slow run and instead of being in the open car for about twenty minutes I was in it exactly two hours and ten minutes.
Sentence 22: That is the actual, simple fact.
Sentence 23: Q. Do you care to make any comment at all on what Mr. Black said?
Sentence 24: I am sure you will recall this—we all like surgical precision —
THE PRESIDENT: "Surgical" is good.
Sentence 25: Q.
Sentence 26: [Mr. Anderson] (Reading).
Sentence 27: "I know only what I have read in the newspapers.
Sentence 28: I know that the stories are running serially and their publication is not complete.
Sentence 29: Mr. Justice Black is abroad.
Sentence 30: Until such time as he returns there is no further comment to be made.
Sentence 31: "Now
Sentence 32: he is back.
Sentence 33: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 34: Well, there isn't any comment.
Sentence 35: Q.
Sentence 36: That probably implied that there would be, did it not?
Sentence 37: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 38: No.
Sentence 39: It strongly implied that there was a possibility, that is all; not that it would be.
Sentence 40: I know my English.
Sentence 41: Q. "Until?"THE PRESIDENT; No.
Sentence 42: Q.
Sentence 43: I wonder if you could help us a little bit in interpreting.
Sentence 44: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 45: Perhaps I should have used the Wall Street term,"when, as and if.
Sentence 46: "
Q. It did imply that there was a possibility and now there is no possibility.
Sentence 47: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 48: Yes.
Sentence 49: It depended on circumstances and subsequent happenings.
Sentence 50: Q.
Sentence 51: Can we take it, then, that your attitude from now on—
THE PRESIDENT: You cannot take anything, Bob.
Sentence 52: That is an "if" question.
Sentence 53: Q.
Sentence 54: When will you determine whether there shall be an extra session of Congress?
Sentence 55: THE PRESIDENT: I should say within the next week.
Sentence 56: i have to get back to Washington and do some checking up down there.
Sentence 57: Q.
Sentence 58: What are the conditions that will bear on that decision, the extent to which Congress is ready to proceed legislatively?
Sentence 59: THE PRESIDENT: Partly that and partly the opinions of various people that I want to talk to and have not had a chance to talk to.
Sentence 60: I would say, for background, that probably threefourths of the Members of Congress to whom I talked on the trip are in favor of a Special Session.
Sentence 61: Q. By the way, you did talk to the Senate Farm Committee at Spokane, Pope and McGill?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 62: I did not see them at Spokane.
Sentence 63: I think I saw Pope on the way out, did I not?
Sentence 64: Q.
Sentence 65: I think so.
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 67: But I have not seen any of them since they started their hearings.
Sentence 68: I believe somebody on the train had seen them at Spokane
Q. That was Jim Murray.
Sentence 69: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 70: Yes, Jim Murray, that was it, and he told me how they had gotten on.
Sentence 71: Q.
Sentence 72: He was under the impression that you had seen them too.
Sentence 73: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 74: No, he simply told me he had talked to them and he thought they were getting on very well.
Sentence 75: Q.
Sentence 76: He told me they did think there should be an extra Session by all means.
Sentence 77: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 78: Yes.
Sentence 79: Q. Is this November 15 a good guess if you do have an extra Session?
Sentence 80: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 81: Well, I do hate to specify a date.
Sentence 82: If I were writing the story, I would say somewhere between the 8th and the 16th because that would give them time, if there is a Special Session, to get most of the spade-work done before the Christmas holidays.
Sentence 83: If it were made too late they would run right into the Christmas holidays before they really got anywhere.
Sentence 84: Q. Are we safe in assuming that wages and hours would come in for consideration by that Special Session, if there is one?
Sentence 85: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 86: If I were writing the story I would mention the principal things such as the crop bill, wages and hours, reorganization, regional planning and, by the way, on regional planning, of course it is easy to say "the little TVA's," but of course they are not.
Sentence 87: Q.
Sentence 88: They are not?
Sentence 89: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 90: No, they are not TVA's.
Sentence 91: They are not at all TVA's.
Sentence 92: In other words, the TVA, under the law, is given complete charge over a whole region, a whole watershed and, if a dam is to be built, the TVA builds it.
Sentence 93: When an electric transmission line is to be run, the TVA runs it.
Sentence 94: When there is soil erosion work to be done, the TVA does it, and the TVA is doing quite a lot of that replanting.
Sentence 95: When it is a question of building certain communities, you will notice that the TVA is doing it.
Sentence 96: In other words, it is a complete administrative agency for that region.
Sentence 97: Now, the bill which Senator Norris has is an entirely different thing.
Sentence 98: It does not create any Board or Commission with administrative authority.
Sentence 99: It is.
Sentence 100: merely a planning agency and, as the bill is drawn, it is nothing more than a planning agency.
Sentence 101: Of course on the administrative end, things depend a good deal on how the reorganization bill goes through.
Sentence 102: The idea of the reorganization plan originally was that there would be a Public Works Department.
Sentence 103: Now that has been eliminated; but we can arrive at the same objective by an entirely different method by coordinating all of the public works agencies of the Government through the President's office so that after a plan for a region is made, the Congress and the President would then determine who would carry out the plan.
Sentence 104: Now, it would not be in one agency, necessarily.
Sentence 105: There might be a dam on the Columbia River, a new one, three or four or five years from now which had been recommended and which Congress appropriated for.
Sentence 106: Now, in all probability, that dam would be built by the Army Engineers or the Reclamation Service and not by the Columbia Valley Authority because that is only a planning agency.
Sentence 107: Do you see the distinction?
Sentence 108: Q.
Sentence 109: The agency would determine how much of the program is to be carried out at any one time?
Sentence 110: THE PRESIDENT: No, the agency would only make recommendations to the planning agency of the President—the national planning agency under the White House.
Sentence 111: I think the easiest way of putting it is this: Suppose there are eight regional agencies, and they make recommendations for 800 million dollars to be spent.
Sentence 112: They all come in with their recommendations and they amount to 800 million dollars.
Sentence 113: The President confers with the Director of the Budget and with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Sentence 114: We say, "This is perfectly absurd.
Sentence 115: We cannot possibly recommend to the Congress 800 million dollars of public works.
Sentence 116: We can only recommend 200 million dollars.
Sentence 117: "
So we get them all in, the eight chairmen, around the table and make them cut their 800 million dollars down to 200 million dollars.
Sentence 118: Some are made to cut more than others but the total amount involved is cut from 800 to 200 million.
Sentence 119: We list those in a list marked "A" and we list another 200 million dollars, let us say, in a list marked "B" and we send those two lists to the Congress as part of the budget; and we say to the Congress, "Here is what we have all agreed on as being the best projects.
Sentence 120: They are in list 'A' and we can afford 200 million dollars which they will cost but, for your information, here are the next best, another 200 million dollars; and it is entirely in the discretion of you gentlemen as to whether you want list 'A' as it is or take something out of list 'A' and substitute something from list 'B', that is in your discretion.
Sentence 121: The only thing we ask is that your total do not exceed the 200 million dollars.
Sentence 122: You can even, if you gentlemen of the Congress think it is wise, authorize something that is not on either list 'A' or list 'B'.
Sentence 123: That is solely a matter of Congressional discretion, but don't go beyond 200 million dollars.
Sentence 124: "
Q. I wonder if you would give us a brief resume on what you "in took.
Sentence 125: "
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 126: Gosh, it is awfully hard to do it off the record.
Sentence 127: Q. Do it on the record.
Sentence 128: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 129: Or on the record.
Sentence 130: Well, I "in took" the general situation west of the Mississippi because I did not get much of a chance to see things east of the Mississippi.
Sentence 131: First of all, the crop situation is infinitely better than at any time in the last four years; even, on the whole, better than 1935 which was not a serious drought year, and a great deal better than 1934 and 1936.
Sentence 132: Q.
Sentence 133: You could have got that from the Department of Agriculture here.
Sentence 134: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 135: Yes, I could, but I always like to check figures and statistics.
Sentence 136: Q.
Sentence 137: You have to see them?
Sentence 138: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 139: Yes, that is right.
Sentence 140: Number two, I think there is a better understanding of what it is all about than there has been at any time in the past.
Sentence 141: Q. On the part of whom?
Sentence 142: THE PRESIDENT: On the part of the voters, on the part of the population.
Sentence 143: Q.
Sentence 144: You don't mean the same one they had in November, do you?
Sentence 145: THE PRESIDENT: Let me give you an illustration: I mentioned several times, for instance, that PWA and WPA projects have got to be curtailed.
Sentence 146: There would have been an awful holier a year or two years ago or three years ago if I had said that.
Sentence 147: Today there is a general understanding of that fact.
Sentence 148: Q.
Sentence 149: When you say, "What it is all about," you mean what the Administration is doing?
Sentence 150: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 151: Yes.
Sentence 152: Q. Don't you think that links with number one in took—better crops?
Sentence 153: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 154: No, I do not think it is a question of better crops.
Sentence 155: Q.
Sentence 156: Do you think they have the understanding—
THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps better crops help them to a better understanding, but there is an understanding that it is not a mere hand-out program, but that it is an economic program which shifts with the economic condition of the country.
Sentence 157: It is an understanding that we are not going to keep people on relief when we do not need to. . . .
Sentence 158: Q. Here is an impossible question which my editors keep asking me: You are going to put many new millions of acres into cultivation and, at the same time, we are curtailing crops elsewhere?
Sentence 159: THE PRESIDENT: Certainly.
Sentence 160: Q. There seems to be a conflict there.
Sentence 161: THE PRESIDENT; Why?
Q. Isn't there a conflict when you put more acres into cultivation at the same time you are trying to reduce acreage elsewhere?
Sentence 162: THE PRESIDENT: Not at all.
Sentence 163: Q.
Sentence 164: Why?
THE PRESIDENT: Because the reduction of acreage takes place, in almost every case, on poor land.
Sentence 165: Q. Well, the new acreage will grow more than the old ones did, and they grew too much.
Sentence 166: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 167: No, they won't grow more than the old ones did.
Sentence 168: That is exactly the point.
Sentence 169: Q. No?
THE PRESIDENT: Do you remember that drive from Glasgow down to Fort Peck?
Sentence 170: That is almost all upland.
Sentence 171: None of that land ought to be cultivated; none of it at all.
Sentence 172: Well, what are you going to do with the families on it, throw them into the cities and put them on relief?
Sentence 173: We have got to move them somewhere.
Sentence 174: Where?
Sentence 175: Suppose you put them down in the Boise Valley.
Sentence 176: That upland farmer was farming 300 acres of wheat and he had not made a good crop for the last seven or eight years.
Sentence 177: Take him down and put him on 40 acres in the Boise Valley.
Sentence 178: He does not grow wheat, he grows small stuff, garden crops like onions of which there is a very little surplus at the present time.
Sentence 179: You have transferred him from a crop which has a large surplus into another crop which has virtually no surplus.
Sentence 180: Q. Mr. President, we heard constantly as we went through the West that there wasn't any interest any more in agricultural legislation, especially anything that carried crop curtailment, because they had good crops and good prices for the moment.
Sentence 181: Did you sense that feeling or have you had reports—
THE PRESIDENT: There is always, when you get a pretty good price and a good crop yield, a slackening of interest.
Sentence 182: Of course most of them realize and remember what has happened in the past.
Sentence 183: There is very little—not nearly as much as one would expect— of the lack of interest that would normally come, because they do remember what did happen and they say to themselves, "If we do not do something about it at the present time, it will happen again."
Sentence 184: They are much better educated than they have been.
Sentence 185: Q.
Sentence 186: So you feel it won't be difficult to put through this farm legislation when Congress returns?
Sentence 187: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 188: No.
Sentence 189: And of course the other side of it is that if it does not go through, they are bound to have an awful smash in crop prices; and then they will be the first to come and demand that we do just what we are trying to do for them this year.
Sentence 190: Q. Not changing the subject, but did you intake anything on the Supreme Court issue?
Sentence 191: THE PRESIDENT: Apparently no real interest in the method but a great deal of interest in the objectives.
Sentence 192: In other words, the average man throughout the West and all through the East says, "Quicker, cheaper justice, extremely advisable and very necessary.
Sentence 193: We have all had our experiences.
Sentence 194: We do not know much about details.
Sentence 195: Maybe the President is right, maybe the President is wrong, but what we are after is the objective.
Sentence 196: "
Q. May we add something about the judiciary to that legislative program?
Sentence 197: THE PRESIDENT: You are a little premature.
Sentence 198: I don't know.
Sentence 199: I would not put it in now because it will be too much of a guess.
Sentence 200: I don't know.
Sentence 201: Q. How about the anti-lynching bill.
Sentence 202: It is my recollection that the Senators—
Q. We had a discussion about that.
Sentence 203: Does that have to come up at the Special Session, if there is one?
Sentence 204: THE PRESIDENT: It has to come up under the Senate rule that they vote on it immediately after the passage of the crop bill.
Sentence 205: It has passed the House already.
Sentence 206: Q.
Sentence 207: What is there that you can do to reach the objective other than what you did do?
Sentence 208: THE PRESIDENT: That is what I am going to talk about when I get back to Washington.
Sentence 209: Q.
Sentence 210: What are you going to talk about when you get back to Washington?
Sentence 211: THE PRESIDENT: For instance, the question of additional District judges.
Sentence 212: That is one method.
Sentence 213: I don't know.
Sentence 214: I think the Circuit Court judges recommended twelve.
Sentence 215: I think the Department of Justice recommended twenty-four.
Sentence 216: Well, we obviously need to do something about it.
Sentence 217: Whether it is twelve or twenty-four is not the important thing.
Sentence 218: Q. Should we consider the Supreme Court out of it, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 219: No, not necessarily but, on the other hand, I would not say that you can consider it in.
Sentence 220: Q.
Sentence 221: Returning to that speech of yesterday, in view of its extreme importance, I think it would be very valuable if you would answer a few questions or else talk for background.
Sentence 222: THE PRESIDENT: I think on that I can only talk really completely off the record.
Sentence 223: I don't want to say anything for background.
Sentence 224: Q.
Sentence 225: I had two major things in mind.
Sentence 226: One was what you had in mind with reference to quarantining—what type of measure.
Sentence 227: Secondly, how would you reconcile the policy you outlined yesterday with the policy of neutrality laid down by the Act of Congress?
Sentence 228: THE PRESIDENT: Read the last line I had in the speech.
Sentence 229: That gives it about as well as anything else.
Sentence 230: (Looking through New York Herald Tribune of October 6.)
Sentence 231: Q. I don't believe that paper carried it.
Sentence 232: (Laughter)
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 233: Here it is: "Therefore America actively engages in the search for peace."
Q.
Sentence 234: But you also said that the peace-loving nations can and must find a way to make their wills prevail.
Sentence 235: THE PRESIDENT: Yes?
Sentence 236: Q.
Sentence 237: And you were speaking, as I interpreted it, you were speaking of something more than moral indignation.
Sentence 238: That is preparing the way for collaborative—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 239: Yes?
Q. Is anything contemplated?
Sentence 240: Have you moved?
Sentence 241: THE PRESIDENT: No; just the speech itself.
Sentence 242: Q.
Sentence 243: Yes, but how do you reconcile that?
Sentence 244: Do you accept the fact that that is a repudiation of the neutrality—
THE PRESIDENT; Not for a minute.
Sentence 245: It may be an expansion.
Sentence 246: Q. Is that for use?
Sentence 247: THE PRESIDENT: All off the record.
Sentence 248: Q. Doesn't that mean economic sanctions anyway?
Sentence 249: THE PRESIDENT: No, not necessarily.
Sentence 250: Look, "sanctions" is a terrible word to use.
Sentence 251: They are out of the window.
Sentence 252: Q. Right.
Sentence 253: Let's not call it that.
Sentence 254: Let's call it concert of action on the part of peace-loving nations.
Sentence 255: Is that going to be brought into play?
Sentence 256: THE PRESIDENT: I don't know that I can give you spot news be-cause the lead is in the last line, "America actively engages in the search for peace."
Sentence 257: I can't tell you what the methods will be.
Sentence 258: We are looking for some way to peace; and by no means is it necessary that that way be contrary to the exercise of neutrality.
Sentence 259: Q. Is there a likelihood that there will be a conference of the peace-loving nations?
Sentence 260: THE PRESIDENT: No; conferences are out of the window.
Sentence 261: You never get anywhere with a conference.
Sentence 262: Q. Foreign papers put it as an attitude without a program.
Sentence 263: THE PRESIDENT: That was the London Times.
Sentence 264: Q. Would you say that that is not quite it, that you are looking toward a program as well as having an attitude?
Sentence 265: THE PRESIDENT: It is an attitude, and it does not outline a pro-gram; but it says we are looking for a program.
Sentence 266: Q. Wouldn't it be almost inevitable, if any program is reached, that our present Neutrality Act will have to be overhauled?
Sentence 267: THE PRESIDENT: Not necessarily.
Sentence 268: That is the interesting thing.
Sentence 269: Q.
Sentence 270: That is very interesting.
Sentence 271: Q.
Sentence 272: You say there isn't any conflict between what you outline and the Neutrality Act.
Sentence 273: They seem to be on opposite poles to me and your assertion does not enlighten me.
Sentence 274: THE PRESIDENT: Put your thinking-cap on, Ernest [Lindley].
Sentence 275: Q. I have been for some years.
Sentence 276: They seem to be at opposite poles.
Sentence 277: How can you be neutral if you are going to align yourself with one group of nations?
Sentence 278: THE PRESIDENT: What do you mean, "aligning"?
Sentence 279: You mean a treaty?
Sentence 280: Q. Not necessarily.
Sentence 281: I meant action on the part of peace-loving nations.
Sentence 282: THE PRESIDENT: There are a lot of methods in the world that have never been tried yet.
Sentence 283: Q.
Sentence 284: But, at any rate, that is not an indication of neutral attitude-"quarantine the aggressors" and "other nations of the world.
Sentence 285: "
THE PRESIDENT: I can't give you any clue to it.
Sentence 286: You will have to invent one.
Sentence 287: I have got one.
Sentence 288: Q. Did you notice that Senator Borah praised the speech?
Sentence 289: Q.
Sentence 290: This is no longer neutrality.
Sentence 291: THE PRESIDENT: On the contrary, it might be a stronger neutrality.
Sentence 292: Q.
Sentence 293: I mean as related to- (interrupted)
Sentence 294: Q.
Sentence 295: This is all off the record?
Sentence 296: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 297: Yes, this is all off the record.
Sentence 298: Q.
Sentence 299: I wanted to ask something else about the Supreme Court thing.
Sentence 300: Did you notice any difference in the attitude of the people toward your Supreme Court policy and the attitude that was manifested by the representatives in Congress last Session?
Sentence 301: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 302: Depends on which one you mean.
Sentence 303: There were 435 different attitudes in the House and 96 in the Senate.
Sentence 304: Q.
Sentence 305: Well, they only voted once.
Sentence 306: THE PRESIDENT: That was a catch vote, as you know.
Sentence 307: Q.
Sentence 308: Do you agree or disagree with what apparently amounts to the conclusion of the British, that sanctions mean war?
Sentence 309: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 310: No. Don't talk about sanctions.
Sentence 311: Never suggested it.
Sentence 312: As I said to Jimmie, don't get off on the sanction route.
Sentence 313: Q.
Sentence 314: I meant that in general terms; going further than moral denunciation.
Sentence 315: THE PRESIDENT: That is not a definition of "sanctions.
Sentence 316: "
Q. Is a "quarantine" a sanction?
Sentence 317: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 318: No.
Q.
Sentence 319: Are you excluding any coercive action?
Sentence 320: Sanctions is coercive.
Sentence 321: THE PRESIDENT: That is exactly the difference.
Sentence 322: Q. Better, then, to keep it in a moral sphere?
Sentence 323: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 324: No, it can be a very practical sphere.
