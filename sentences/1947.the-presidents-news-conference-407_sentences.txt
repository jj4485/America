Sentence 1: 1947 The Presidents News Conference 407

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: Gentlemen, I have no--and ladies--[ laughter ]--I have no special announcements to make to you this morning.
Sentence 3: If you have any questions you want to ask, I will try to answer them.
Sentence 4: [1.]
Sentence 5: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us something about your economic survey with the Cabinet yesterday?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 6: The meeting of the Cabinet on the quarterly review of the economic situation was a postponed meeting from the week before.
Sentence 7: There wasn't any special meeting for any special purpose.
Sentence 8: It was just simply a discussion of the situation, which is continuing.
Sentence 9: [2.]
Sentence 10: Q. Mr. President, judging from your Saturday night speech,
1
you are concerned about higher prices still ?
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 12: I have stated that emphatically here, I think--as emphatically as it can be said.
Sentence 13: 1
Item 68.
Sentence 14: Q. Well, this reporter has been going around to some people who are a little afraid to reduce prices on their own as they want company against their competitors.
Sentence 15: After talking about the possibility of getting together a group of companies to reduce them, they are a little afraid of the antitrust laws, afraid they might be accused of combining for the purpose of reducing prices.
Sentence 16: Would the Department of Justice prosecute under the antitrust laws?
Sentence 17: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 18: Yes, the Department of Justice could.
Sentence 19: But I think, if the Department of Justice is consulted about the meeting, that it wouldn't.
Sentence 20: Q. Have you received any news from other companies that.
Sentence 21: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 22: Yes.
Sentence 23: We have had telegrams from several companies, and I am very much gratified that they are making the attempt to reduce the high price structure.
Sentence 24: [3.]
Sentence 25: Q. Mr. President, in that same speech you spoke about the budget being balanced this year.
Sentence 26: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 27: That's right.
Sentence 28: Q.
Sentence 29: What are your figures on that?
Sentence 30: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 31: The figures are not--the total figures are not available.
Sentence 32: We know that there will be a surplus, and I will announce the amount just as soon as I have the exact figures.
Sentence 33: [4.]
Sentence 34: Q. Mr. President, that question on the Department of Justice and the meeting, what you are suggesting, as I understand it, is that if a group came in and obtained consent from the Attorney General, they could then take combined action to reduce prices?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 35: I think that can be done.
Sentence 36: Q. Mr. President, on higher prices again, Mr. Nourse said before his meeting with you, that he considered the situation serious and that the administration so considered it.
Sentence 37: Do you contemplate taking any action in addition to appeals by--any action on prices ?
Sentence 38: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 39: We are surveying situation, to see whether there is any action possible.
Sentence 40: You see, the price control law was repealed on the 30th day of last June, and an impossible price control bill was passed on the 25th of July which was not workable, and which came out just exactly as the veto message explained that it would come out.
Sentence 41: We have no real authority now, although we may--we are going to try to do everything we possibly can to meet the situation.
Sentence 42: That's what the discussion is for.
Sentence 43: Q. Mr. President, still on prices, would you favor an increase in the ceiling on the veterans on-the-job training?
Sentence 44: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 45: I haven't gone into that subject, but I think the veterans have been very liberally taken care of on that situation.
Sentence 46: [5.]
Sentence 47: Q. Mr. President, what do you think of what John Hanes said yesterday, that there would be a surplus of 3 or 4 billion this fiscal year?
Sentence 48: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 49: Is that the gentleman who had the center column in the New York Times this morning?
Sentence 50: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 51: I believe he was.
Sentence 52: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: I wonder where he got his figures?
Sentence 54: It seems to me that he must have got his figures from the same place that Knutson got his $6 billion cut--I don't think from any reliable source.
Sentence 55: [6.]
Sentence 56: Q. Mr. President, do you think that the Joint Committee on the Economic Report has any responsibility for any of the tensions we now are coming up to?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 57: I can't answer that question.
Sentence 58: I don't know.
Sentence 59: [7.]
Sentence 60: Q. Mr. President, may I ask you a local question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 61: Sure.
Sentence 62: Q. Would you care to say anything about the visit of Commissioner Young to your office yesterday morning?
Sentence 63: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: He just came in to discuss administrative matters in the District, which he does once in a while.
Sentence 65: We had a very pleasant conversation on the situation in the District.
Sentence 66: Q.
Sentence 67: He says you asked him to come up here on something that you wanted to tell him?
Sentence 68: It might make news.
Sentence 69: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: I don't want to tell you anything about the conversation we had.
Sentence 71: It will come out later all right.
Sentence 72: [8.]
Sentence 73: Q. Mr. President, have you a successor named yet to District Attorney Woll of Chicago?
Sentence 74: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 75: No, not that I know of.
Sentence 76: I don't think it has been handed to me as yet.
Sentence 77: [9.]
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, going back to the last question on the Economic Report, your Economic Report went to Congress and was rather well ignored, I thought.
Sentence 79: I am wondering whether you think it would be constructive if Congress would pay some attention to your Economic Report ?
Sentence 80: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: The reorganization bill in Congress was passed by it for that purpose.
Sentence 82: [10.]
Sentence 83: Q. Mr. President, were you instructing the Department of Justice to entertain inquiries from American business on joint action cutting prices?
Sentence 84: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 85: The matter is under discussion.
Sentence 86: I can give you an answer on that at a later date.
Sentence 87: Q. Mr. President, what would be the safeguards against price fixing in that arrangement?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 88: That is a matter that the smart legal boys will have to work out.
Sentence 89: There is one decision of the Supreme Court which places a restriction on a unanimous price cut, just the same as it does on a unanimous price rise, and that will have to be examined by the Attorney General before any decision can be made.
Sentence 90: Q. Mr. President, did your economic experts find any evidence that prices are about to turn down?
Sentence 91: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: They made some statements to the effect that some prices are likely to come down, and some have.
Sentence 93: Q. Mr. President, are you in favor of reduction in the prices of foodstuffs as well as manufactured articles ?
Sentence 94: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 95: Certainly.
Sentence 96: Q. Mr. President, are you in favor of a buyers' strike against high prices ?
Sentence 97: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 98: No I am not.
Sentence 99: I think a buyers' strike wouldn't help the situation at all.
Sentence 100: Q. Mr. President, would you tell us why that is?
Sentence 101: That buyers' strike is something that is very popular with people.
Sentence 102: I would like to hear from you--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 103: Well, the buyers' strike is just like any other sort of strike.
Sentence 104: It stops the economic machinery from working and that always throws a monkey wrench into the machinery.
Sentence 105: You know--none of these strikes that we had last year helped anybody--hurt the whole economy of the country.
Sentence 106: Q. Mr. President, the Government buys enough materials--if it curtailed its purchases, would it affect the economy?
Sentence 107: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: NO, I don't think so.
Sentence 109: I think our purchases have been enormously curtailed.
Sentence 110: I know that is a fact.
Sentence 111: Q. What about strikes this year, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 112: Well, I hope the strikes this year will not have the same effect they did last year; and I am hoping for settlement of the proposed strikes this year.
Sentence 113: Q. Mr. President, if high prices bring on an inability to buy, does--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 114: That's a different thing.
Sentence 115: Q. Does it have the same effect?
Sentence 116: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: It would have the same effect as when a man can't sell his merchandise at his own price, he has to put them out at a price at which he can sell.
Sentence 118: That is supply and demand, if I know anything about free economy.
Sentence 119: [11.]
Sentence 120: Q. Mr. President, going back to the question of the antitrust laws in group price reductions, do you think it is possible to make such reductions?
Sentence 121: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 122: I hope it is possible.
Sentence 123: We are trying to find a way so that it will be possible.
Sentence 124: The Attorney General is working on it now.
Sentence 125: Q. Would that have to be done by the manufacturers themselves, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 126: I don't know anything about that.
Sentence 127: Have to go into the thing in detail.
Sentence 128: That is a matter for business itself to work out.
Sentence 129: Business wanted to be free of price control.
Sentence 130: They are free of price control.
Sentence 131: Now they will have to meet the situation.
Sentence 132: Q.
Sentence 133: The Government itself, then, wouldn't have any machinery other than a moral request?
Sentence 134: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 135: That's all.
Sentence 136: That's all.
Sentence 137: [12.]
Sentence 138: Q. Mr. President, do you intend to make public the report of your Committee of Economic Advisers ?
Sentence 139: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 140: NO.
Sentence 141: It isn't for publication.
Sentence 142: [13.]
Sentence 143: Q. Mr. President, you specified receiving several telegrams from different companies.
Sentence 144: Would you care to specify what those companies were ?
Sentence 145: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 146: There were half a dozen of them.
Sentence 147: Their names will be released later.
Sentence 148: I haven't them before me now.
Sentence 149: [14.]
Sentence 150: Q. Mr. President, there has been some talk about you and Senator Taft going into a huddle on labor regulatory measures.
Sentence 151: Would you welcome such a conference ?
Sentence 152: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 153: I haven't been asked to go into such a conference.
Sentence 154: [15.]
Sentence 155: Q. What about those telegrams?
Sentence 156: Are these from concerns that want to reduce prices?
Sentence 157: I didn't
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 158: Yes.
Sentence 159: They were from concerns who have reduced prices as a result of the statement that was made here in the press conference last week and before.
Sentence 160: Q. Mr. President, at the present moment, until this investigation is completed, you are pretty limited to moral suasion, is that right?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 161: That's right.
Sentence 162: That's right.
Sentence 163: Q.
Sentence 164: What was that?
Sentence 165: We didn't hear.
Sentence 166: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: He said I was limited to moral persuasion on this thing.
Sentence 168: He is correct.
Sentence 169: Q. Mr. President, in line with moral suasion, have you any intention of calling in any great business leaders, presenting the situation to them personally?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 170: I have talked to a great many of them already.
Sentence 171: Q. Personally?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 172: Personally, yes.
Sentence 173: Q.
Sentence 174: Whom have you talked to?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 175: Well--that is my business.
Sentence 176: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, has any group of representative manufacturers proposed to the Government that the antitrust laws be so adjusted so that they--
THE PRESIDENT, I think some questions have been asked of the Attorney General.
Sentence 177: Q. Mr. President, in the meantime, as I understand it, the responsibility is now on business ?
Sentence 178: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 179: What's that?
Sentence 180: Q. Is the responsibility now on business?
Sentence 181: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: Absolutely.
Sentence 183: Squarely on business.
Sentence 184: That is where they wanted it.
Sentence 185: They want free enterprise.
Sentence 186: They have got it.
Sentence 187: Now let's see if they will make it work.
Sentence 188: Q.
Sentence 189: In your conversations with the business heads, did they make any request to cut prices, unless they have to stand wage boosts ?
Sentence 190: Do they bring that into the
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 191: No, that hasn't been brought into the subject--
Q.
Sentence 192: That is not tied Up--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 193: --and the profits this year are, for the year 1947--have been very great.
Sentence 194: Q. Mr. President, you made an interesting statement a moment ago, that responsibility is squarely on business.
Sentence 195: I wonder if we could put have that read back and put it in quotes, sir?
Sentence 196: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 197: I think you can handle it well enough without putting it in direct quotes.
Sentence 198: [Laughter] You ought to be able to handle that.
Sentence 199: Q. Mr. President, you said 1947 profits.
Sentence 200: Do you mean 1947 or 19467
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 201: 1946, and the first-
Q. And the first quarter of 1947?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 202: the first quarter of 1947, and the whole of 1946, except the first quarter of 1946.
Sentence 203: Q. How did you describe that--very large?
Sentence 204: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 205: Very great profits.
Sentence 206: Q. Mr. President, in view of these high profits and high prices, would that soon justify wage increases if they are not brought down?
Sentence 207: THE PRESIDENT, Yes.
Sentence 208: Q. Mr. President, how do you fit labor into the picture ?
Sentence 209: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 210: I have been trying to fit labor into the picture ever since 1945, when the war ended.
Sentence 211: You remember we called a labor-management conference to try to work these things out together.
Sentence 212: Didn't succeed very well.
Sentence 213: And we have been, ever since, trying to arrive at adjustments between labor and management so that everybody could have a fair deal.
Sentence 214: Everybody ought to have a fair deal on this situation.
Sentence 215: If we get a fair deal for everybody, why the country will be all right.
Sentence 216: Q. Mr. President, did you say that wage increases--further wage increases would be justified if prices didn't come down?
Sentence 217: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 218: Yes.
Sentence 219: [16.]
Sentence 220: Q. Mr. President, your budget for the fiscal year 1948 would include an item of $160 million for keeping up the prices of foodstuffs on farm commodities ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 221: That is correct.
Sentence 222: On a parity basis, that is.
Sentence 223: Q. Is there any proposal to amend that?
Sentence 224: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 225: It has been under consideration.
Sentence 226: [17.]
Sentence 227: Q. Mr. President, are you also studying the matter of taxing away abnormal profits ?
Sentence 228: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 229: Well, if you remember, the excess profits tax was repealed, with the idea that it would help business, and it was repealed for that purpose.
Sentence 230: It did help business, and therefore I am inclined to think that business appreciates that help and will make every effort to meet this situation.
Sentence 231: At least, I hope so.
Sentence 232: Q.
Sentence 233: I understand some show an increase up to 300 percent in profits.
Sentence 234: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 235: I haven't seen the exact figures.
Sentence 236: [18.]
Sentence 237: Q. Mr. President, can we take that to mean, sir, that you are suggesting you have under consideration amending the price support on agricultural commodities ?
Sentence 238: Would that go to cotton, too, and wool?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 239: The situation is being considered by the Congress.
Sentence 240: I don't know what action they are going to take on it, and I can't make any prophecies as to what action they will take.
Sentence 241: Your guess is as good as mine on that.
Sentence 242: Q. Mr. President, would it be desirable for Congress to remove these supporting subsidies?
Sentence 243: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 244: Well, we can't answer that.
Sentence 245: We can't answer that question until we find out what the world crop situation will be in the coming year.
Sentence 246: Depends altogether on what that situation is.
Sentence 247: If there are tremendous farm surpluses, we would be faced with the same conditions that we were in the past on that subject.
Sentence 248: Q. Mr. President, wasn't the Government committed to support of farm prices for 2 years ?
Sentence 249: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 250: The Government is committed for 2 years after the war.
Sentence 251: That is, 2 years from the 31st day of last December.
Sentence 252: Q.
Sentence 253: What you are talking about then now is, in answer to these questions, would it mean going back on that?
Sentence 254: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 255: No.
Sentence 256: No. Can't go back on that commitment.
Sentence 257: [19.]
Sentence 258: Q. Mr. President, a few weeks ago you said you didn't believe for a minute that there was going to be a recession.
Sentence 259: Do you still feel that way?
Sentence 260: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 261: I feel that there is no necessity for a recession.
Sentence 262: [20.]
Sentence 263: Q. Mr. President, all these questions show how concerned everybody is about high prices, and I wonder if--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 264: That is true.
Sentence 265: Q. there is any way you could say whether you, as President, have any concrete program-
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 266: The only concrete program I have has been put up to you right here.
Sentence 267: And we are surveying the situation now to find out just exactly what is in prospect, and then see what can be done about it.
Sentence 268: The repeal of price controls ended all control of the Government over prices.
Sentence 269: Q. Mr. President, am I right to assume that you would like to restore price controls?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 270: No.
Sentence 271: I have no desire to restore price controls.
Sentence 272: Not be feasible at the present time, because what we are trying to do now is get prices to come down to a reasonable point.
Sentence 273: Q.
Sentence 274: Yes.
Sentence 275: If there was another way--somebody may rush forward with a price control act--proposal.
Sentence 276: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 277: Well, I don't think--I don't think you would have
Q.
Sentence 278: I was thinking, sir, that is what you were leading up to.
Sentence 279: Maybe I'm wrong.
Sentence 280: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 281: No.
Sentence 282: No, no.
Sentence 283: I am not at all.
Sentence 284: Q.
Sentence 285: How long would it take you to set up machinery, if you reinstituted price control s ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 286: I don't think it is practicable to reinstitute price controls.
Sentence 287: I think people want to get away from controls.
Sentence 288: We want free enterprise in this country, but everybody has got to work at it, if we are going to have it.
Sentence 289: [21.]
Sentence 290: Q. Mr. President, to get away from this subject for a moment, do you find the Senate's action on Lilienthal
1
very gratifying?
Sentence 291: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 292: Yes indeed.
Sentence 293: I thought it was very satisfactory.
Sentence 294: I am sorry they delayed so long in taking it.
Sentence 295: 1
On the previous day the Senate had confirmed David E. Lilienthal as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.
Sentence 296: [22.]
Sentence 297: Q. Mr. President, if moral suasion doesn't work, then would you say that the Government will take some sort of action?
Sentence 298: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 299: I am not ready to answer that question yet.
Sentence 300: Q. Mr. President, the Government has some fiscal controls they could exert, doesn't it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 301: Yes.
Sentence 302: We are investigating that situation now.
Sentence 303: Q. Do you contemplate a message to Congress on this situation ?
Sentence 304: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 305: No, I do not, at the present time.
Sentence 306: Congress is getting plenty of messages from the general public, I think!
Sentence 307: [23.]
Sentence 308: Q. Mr. President, I notice Senator Pepper was on the list last Saturday night.
Sentence 309: Would you care to comment on the status of Senator Pepper and Wallace as members in good standing of the Democratic Party?
Sentence 310: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 311: Mr. Pepper was at the Democratic dinner the other night, and I received him very cordially.
Sentence 312: I have no desire to read anybody out of the Democratic Party.
Sentence 313: Q. Does that go for Mr. Wallace too, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 314: Certainly.
Sentence 315: Q. Would you like to have him campaign on the Democratic ticket next year, Mr. President ?
Sentence 316: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 317: We will take care of that situation when it arises.
Sentence 318: I think they will probably campaign for the Democratic ticket.
Sentence 319: [24.]
Sentence 320: Q.
Sentence 321: Any news, Mr. President, on Mr. Hannegan's possible retirement ?
Sentence 322: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 323: No.
Reporter:
Sentence 324: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 325: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 326: You're welcome.
