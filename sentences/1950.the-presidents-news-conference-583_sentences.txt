Sentence 1: 1950 The Presidents News Conference 583

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: Good morning, everybody.
Sentence 3: Sit down.
Sentence 4: [1.]
Sentence 5: I have got a statement I want to read to you.
Sentence 6: There will be copies available when you get ready to leave here.
Sentence 7: I will take it as slowly as I can.
Sentence 8: [Reading] "Recent developments in Korea confront the world with a serious crisis.
Sentence 9: The Chinese Communist leaders have sent their troops from Manchuria to launch a strong and well-organized attack against the United Nations forces in North Korea.
Sentence 10: This has been done despite prolonged and earnest efforts to bring home to the Communist leaders of China the plain fact that neither the United Nations nor the United States has any aggressive intentions toward China.
Sentence 11: Because of the historic friendship between the people of the United States and China, it is particularly shocking to us to think that Chinese are being forced into battle against our troops in the United Nations command.
Sentence 12: "The Chinese attack was made in great force, and it still continues.
Sentence 13: It has resulted in the forced withdrawal of large parts of the United Nations command.
Sentence 14: The battlefield situation is uncertain at this time.
Sentence 15: We may suffer reverses as we have suffered them before.
Sentence 16: But the forces of the United Nations have no intention of abandoning their mission in Korea."
Sentence 17: [The following sentence is in the statement as released by the White House but was not read by the President.]
Sentence 18: "The forces of the United Nations are in Korea to put down an aggression that threatens not only the whole fabric of the United Nations, but all human hopes of peace and justice."
Sentence 19: [Reading] "If the United Nations yields to the forces of aggression, no nation will be safe or secure.
Sentence 20: If aggression is successful in Korea, we can expect it to spread throughout Asia and Europe to this hemisphere.
Sentence 21: We are fighting in Korea for our own national security and survival.
Sentence 22: "We have committed ourselves to the cause of a just and peaceful world order through the United Nations.
Sentence 23: We stand by that commitment.
Sentence 24: "We shall meet the new situation in three ways.
Sentence 25: "We shall continue to work in the United Nations for concerted action to halt this aggression in Korea.
Sentence 26: "We shall intensify our efforts to help other free nations strengthen their defenses in order to meet the threat of aggression elsewhere.
Sentence 27: "We shall rapidly increase our own military strength.
Sentence 28: "In the United Nations, the first step is action by the Security Council to halt this aggression.
Sentence 29: And Ambassador Warren Austin is pressing for such action.
Sentence 30: We shall exert every effort to help bring the full influence of the United Nations to bear on the situation in Korea.
Sentence 31: "Some had hoped that the normal peaceful process of discussion and negotiation, which is provided through the United Nations, could be successfully entered into with the present Chinese Communist delegation at Lake Success.
Sentence 32: There is, however, no indication that the representatives of Communist China are willing to engage in this process.
Sentence 33: Instead of discussing the real issues, they have been making violent and wholly false statements of the type which have often been used by the Soviet representatives in an effort to prevent the Security Council from acting.
Sentence 34: "We hope that the Chinese people will not continue to be forced or deceived into serving the ends of Russian colonial policy in Asia.
Sentence 35: "I am certain that, if the Chinese people now under the control of the Communists were free to speak for themselves, they would denounce this aggression against the United Nations.
Sentence 36: "Because this new act of aggression in Korea is only a part of a worldwide pattern of danger to all the free nations of the world, it is more necessary than ever before for us to increase at a very rapid rate the combined military strength of the free nations.
Sentence 37: It is more necessary than ever that integrated forces in Europe under a supreme command be established at once.
Sentence 38: "With respect to our own defense, I shall submit a supplemental request for appropriations needed immediately to increase the size and effectiveness of our Armed Forces.
Sentence 39: The request will include a substantial amount for the Atomic Energy Commission in addition to large amounts for the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.
Sentence 40: 1

See Item 296.
Sentence 41: "I expect to confer tomorrow with congressional leaders and ask them to give urgent consideration to these new appropriations.
Sentence 42: "This is a time for all our citizens to lay aside differences and unite in firmness and mutual determination to do what is best for our country and the cause of freedom throughout the world.
Sentence 43: This country is the keystone of the hopes of mankind for peace and justice.
Sentence 44: We must show that we are guided by a common purpose and a common faith.
Sentence 45: "
All right.
Sentence 46: Ask any questions now.
Sentence 47: [2.]
Sentence 48: Q. Mr. President, do you think, in view of this situation, that we should delay any further general mobilization and control of materials and prices and supports and--
THE PRESIDENT That matter is being constantly considered.
Sentence 49: I do not intend to answer the question.
Sentence 50: [3.]
Sentence 51: Q. Mr. President, are you about to name a supreme commander then?
Sentence 52: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: I have been ready to name a supreme commander for a long time.
Sentence 54: Q.
Sentence 55: You are waiting on European--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 56: I am waiting on agreement with our European allies.
Sentence 57: [4.]
Sentence 58: Q. Mr. President, in what detail were you informed about these MacArthur moves?
Sentence 59: 2
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 60: Every detail.
Sentence 61: 2
On November 23 General MacArthur had launched an assault on the Communist forces in Korea in an attempt to end the war.
Sentence 62: On November 28 he issued a special communiqu√© stating that the United Nations forces faced an "entirely new war" with an enemy force of 200,000 men, including a major segment of the Communist Chinese army.
Sentence 63: Q. Did you or the State Department raise the question of whether this offensive would affect the chances of a negotiated settlement with the Peiping government?
Sentence 64: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 65: The whole matter was clearly discussed with General MacArthur every day.
Sentence 66: Q. Mr. President, there has been some criticism of General MacArthur in the European press--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: Some in the American press, too, if I'm not mistaken.
Sentence 68: Q.--particularly in the British press--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 69: They are always for a man when he is winning, but when he is in a little trouble, they all jump on him with what ought to be done, which they didn't tell him before.
Sentence 70: He has done a good job, and he is continuing to do a good job.
Sentence 71: Go ahead with your question.
Sentence 72: Q.
Sentence 73: The particular criticism is that he exceeded his authority and went beyond the point he was supposed to go?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: He did nothing of the kind.
Sentence 75: [Slight pause]
Sentence 76: Well, what's the matter with you?
Sentence 77: [5.]
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, a few months ago this Government declined the offer of Chinese Nationalist troops.
Sentence 79: Has that been up for reconsideration, in view--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 80: The offer of Nationalist Chinese troops was refused for the reason that we hoped not to be involved in a world war.
Sentence 81: That situation still continues.
Sentence 82: [6.]
Sentence 83: Q. Along the same line then, our Formosa policy of neutralization--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: Still continues.
Sentence 85: [7.]
Sentence 86: Q. Mr. President, since the Chinese delegation has shown no inclination to resolve the difficulties, what can be done then?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: We are still working on the thing from every angle.
Sentence 88: The best thing that can be done is to increase our defenses to a point where we can talk--as we should always talk--with authority.
Sentence 89: Q. Mr. President, how wide an increase do you expect to authorize in mobilization of the military--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 90: I will answer that question when I send up the request for the appropriation.
Sentence 91: Q.
Sentence 92: Can you say how large that appropriation will be, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 93: No. I will give it to you when I send it up, which will be in a day or two.
Sentence 94: Q. Is it to go up tomorrow?
Sentence 95: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: Well, I don't think it will be ready.
Sentence 97: I hope it will be, but I don't think it will be.
Sentence 98: [8.]
Sentence 99: Q. Mr. President, what congressional leaders will you see?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: The usual ones.
Sentence 101: Q. Will that include Republicans--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 102: They will come in the White House.
Sentence 103: It's the usual conference that I have--with the usual agenda.
Sentence 104: Q. Will it include Republicans?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 105: It always does.
Sentence 106: Of course it will.
Sentence 107: Don't you remember?
Sentence 108: Remember back, there have been 9 or 10 of these conferences.
Sentence 109: If you will look back and edit them, you will find that your question will be answered.
Sentence 110: Q.
Sentence 111: My editor tells me not to take anything for granted.
Sentence 112: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 113: That's too bad.
Sentence 114: Of course, that is one of the things that's the matter with the country.
Sentence 115: It just exactly states--you have answered a national question when you said that.
Sentence 116: Confidence in your Government is the first thing to keep it running as it should.
Sentence 117: [9.]
Sentence 118: Q. Mr. President, will the United Nations troops be allowed to bomb across the Manchurian border?
Sentence 119: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: I can't answer that question this morning.
Sentence 121: [10.]
Sentence 122: Q. Mr. President, in increasing our military strength, do you consider using the Japanese manpower?
Sentence 123: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 124: Using what?
Q.
Sentence 125: The Japanese manpower, in increasing our military strength--speaking of the United Nations?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 126: We will cross that bridge when we come to it.
Sentence 127: [11.]
Sentence 128: Q. Mr. President, will attacks in Manchuria depend on action in the United Nations ?
Sentence 129: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 130: Yes, entirely.
Sentence 131: Q. In other words, if the United Nations resolution should authorize General MacArthur to go further than he has, he will--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 132: We will take whatever steps are necessary to meet the military situation, just as we always have.
Sentence 133: [12.]
Sentence 134: Q. Will that include the atomic bomb ?
Sentence 135: THE PRESIDENT, That includes every weapon that we have.
Sentence 136: Q. Mr. President, you said "every weapon that we have."
Sentence 137: Does that mean that there is active consideration of the use of the atomic bomb?
Sentence 138: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 139: There has always been active consideration of its use.
Sentence 140: I don't want to see it used.
Sentence 141: It is a terrible weapon, and it should not be used on innocent men, women, and children who have nothing whatever to do with this military aggression.
Sentence 142: That happens when it is used.
Sentence 143: 3

Later the same day the White House issued the following press release:
Sentence 144: "The President wants to make it certain that there is no misinterpretation of his answers m questions at his press conference today about the use of the atom bomb.
Sentence 145: Naturally, there has been consideration of this subject since the outbreak of the hostilities in Korea, just as there is consideration of the use of all military weapons whenever our forces are in combat.
Sentence 146: "Consideration of the use of any weapon is always implicit in the very possession of that weapon.
Sentence 147: "However, it should be emphasized, that, by law, only the President can authorize the use of the atom bomb, and no such authorization has been given.
Sentence 148: If and when such authorization should be given, the military commander in the field would have charge of the tactical delivery of the weapon.
Sentence 149: "In brief, the replies to the questions at today's press conference do not represent any change in this situation."
Sentence 150: [13.]
Sentence 151: Q. Mr. President, Senator Byrd

says not a single dollar for Yugoslavia, and he backed it up this morning with the Southern bloc.
Sentence 152: Have you any comment?
Sentence 153: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 154: No comment.
Sentence 155: We would expect that from Senator Byrd, however.
Sentence 156: 4
Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia.
Sentence 157: [14.]
Sentence 158: Q. Mr. President, I wonder if we could retrace that reference to the atom bomb?
Sentence 159: Did we understand you clearly that the use of the atomic bomb is under active consideration?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 160: Always has been.
Sentence 161: It is one of our weapons.
Sentence 162: Q. Does that mean, Mr. President, use against military objectives, or civilian--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 163: It's a matter that the military people will have to decide.
Sentence 164: I'm not a military authority that passes on those things.
Sentence 165: Q. Mr. President, perhaps it would be better if we are allowed to quote your remarks on that directly?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 166: I don't think--I don't think that is necessary.
Sentence 167: Q. Mr. President, you said this depends on United Nations action.
Sentence 168: Does that mean that we wouldn't use the atomic bomb except on a United Nations authorization ?
Sentence 169: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 170: No, it doesn't mean that at all.
Sentence 171: The action against Communist China depends on the action of the United Nations.
Sentence 172: The military commander in the field will have charge of the use of the weapons, as he always has.
Sentence 173: [15.]
Sentence 174: Q. Mr. President, how dose are we to all-out mobilization.
Sentence 175: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 176: Depends on how this matter we are faced with now works out.
Sentence 177: [16.]
Sentence 178: Q. Mr. President, will the United Nations decide whether the Manchurian border is crossed, either with bombing planes or--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 179: The resolution that is now pending before the United Nations will answer that question.
Sentence 180: Q. Or with troops?
Sentence 181: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: That question will be answered by this resolution.
Sentence 183: 5

On December 14, 1950, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution listing its conditions for a cease-fire in Korea (see the Department of State Bulletin, vol. 24, p. 113).
Sentence 184: [17.]
Sentence 185: Q. Mr. President, do you have to ask any congressional action to proceed further in this situation in Asia?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 186: Money.
Sentence 187: Always have to ask them for money.
Sentence 188: Q. Is it going beyond police action at this time?
Sentence 189: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 190: I can't answer that question.
Sentence 191: That is what we are examining.
Sentence 192: We have exerted every effort possible to prevent a third world war.
Sentence 193: Every maneuver that has been made since June 25th has had in mind not to create a situation which would cause another terrible war.
Sentence 194: We are still trying to prevent that war from happening, and I hope we may be able to prevent it.
Sentence 195: All these attacks and speculations and lies that have been told on the members of this Government have not helped that situation one little bit.
Sentence 196: There's a big one on the front page of the paper this morning, about Acheson having interfered with the command in the Far East.
Sentence 197: There isn't one word of truth in that, and never has been.
Sentence 198: Acheson has attended strictly to his business as Secretary of State, and he has done a good job
I am getting tired of all this foolishment and I'm going to "bust loose" on you one of these days.
Sentence 199: [Laughter]
Sentence 200: [18.]
Sentence 201: Q. You said we are going to-in your statement--intensify our military efforts.
Sentence 202: Do you mean to step it up more than you had planned to step it up, before the events of the--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 203: Yes, it will.
Sentence 204: The end will be attained sooner than we had anticipated would be necessary--that is what it means.
Sentence 205: Q. Same size program?
Sentence 206: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 207: Probably--probably.
Sentence 208: Gotten together more rapidly.
Sentence 209: [19.]
Sentence 210: Q. Mr. President, in intensifying our efforts to build up strong free nations, you refer particularly to the North Atlantic pact countries?
Sentence 211: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 212: That's correct.
Sentence 213: Reporter:
Sentence 214: Thank you, Mr. President.
