Sentence 1: 1948 The Presidents News Conference 660

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have a statement I want to read to you.
Sentence 3: I have been cautioned to read it very slowly by several of you.
Sentence 4: I will read it as slowly as I can.
Sentence 5: It is mimeographed and will be ready for you as soon as you go out.
Sentence 6: [1.]
Sentence 7: "On April an I submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent the nominations of David E. Lilienthal to be Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, of Robert F. Bacher, Sumner T. Pike, Lewis L. Strauss, and William W. Waymack as members of the Atomic Energy Commission.
Sentence 8: "It is now nearly a year and a half since these five men assumed direction of the atomic energy program as the first members of the Atomic Energy Commission established by the Congress on August 1st, 1946.
Sentence 9: During this period, a gigantic atomic energy program has been put into forward motion after the long period of drift which occurred after the war.
Sentence 10: It is imperative that our program in this field continue to advance and that there be no uncertainty in the continuity of the experienced leadership essential for the Nation's preeminence in the field of atomic energy.
Sentence 11: "These names have been resubmitted at this time because of the provision of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 that the terms of all five Commissioners should expire on August the first of this year.
Sentence 12: The purpose of this provision was to permit the President and the Congress to have an opportunity to review the performance of the Commission before beginning the 5-year staggered terms provided for in this act.
Sentence 13: "The reappointment of the 5 Commissioners is based on my firm conviction that under their direction real progress has been made in all phases of our atomic energy program and that under their continued leadership even greater progress will be made.
Sentence 14: The Congress has had a year and a half to observe the performance of these men as members of the Atomic Energy Commission, and I have no doubt that the Joint Commission on Atomic Energy has been diligent in observing their performance.
Sentence 15: I have submitted their names in mid-April in order that there should be sufficient time to enable the Senate to act on their nominations.
Sentence 16: "I am informed that a suggestion has been made that the Senate should not act on these nominations, but that instead the Congress should enact a law extending the terms of the present Commission for 1 or 2 years.
Sentence 17: Such a proposal would restore the pall of uncertainty which surrounded the development of this country's atomic energy program from the Japanese surrender until the spring of 1947, when the present Commission was confirmed.
Sentence 18: Such a proposal would have an adverse effect on the urgent business of pushing ahead in our knowledge and utilization of atomic energy, both for use in our economy and for our defense.
Sentence 19: "The present members of the Commission were appointed without any reference to their political affiliations.
Sentence 20: Since we all recognize the need for a vigorous nonpartisan development of our atomic energy program, I strongly urge that these nominations be considered on the schedule originally set by the Congress."
Sentence 21: And which is now the
law.
Sentence 22: Q. In other words, you are against any compromise?
Sentence 23: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 24: I am for carrying out the law that the Congress itself made, and which I have been trying to enforce to the best of my ability, and in a manner that has no connection whatever with politics.
Sentence 25: These men came in here to see me about their staggered terms, and I told them to go back and settle it among themselves.
Sentence 26: They did make a settlement among themselves, and I sent the appointments down as they themselves had agreed on.
Sentence 27: Q. Mr. President, have you discussed this with Senator Vandenberg?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 28: I have not.
Sentence 29: Q. Mr. President, did Senator Hickenlooper propose to you, before those names went up, that these--there be some sort of compromise adjustment on the terms, when he was in here?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 30: Senator Hickenlooper came up and discussed with me what he thought would be the attitude of the Senate.
Sentence 31: That's all the discussion was.
Sentence 32: And it was a private conversation between the Senator and myself.
Sentence 33: [2.]
Sentence 34: Q. Mr. President, on these appointments, can you tell us when you plan to name Marriner Eccles Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board?

Sentence 37: [3.]
Sentence 38: Q. Have you anything to say about the railroad strike at this moment?
Sentence 39: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 40: No, I haven't.
Sentence 41: The Conciliation Service is working heroically to get that strike settled--the proposed strike settled.
Sentence 42: I think they are going to have good luck.
Sentence 43: At least, I hope so.
Sentence 44: [4.]

Sentence 48: Q. Mr. President, the Boeing strike in Seattle has now been going on 2 weeks.
Sentence 49: Have you any thought of appointing a board of investigation, or of issuing an injunction.--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 50: I don't think that is a national emergency.
Sentence 51: Therefore, I cannot appoint a board on it.
Sentence 52: Q.
Sentence 53: You do not think it is?
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: No, I do not.
Sentence 56: [6.]
Sentence 57: Q. Mr. President, the other day I looked into this matter of putting off the confirmation of appointments, and so forth, and while these five men are the most conspicuous, there are about a thousand postmasters still pending--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: That's right.
Q.--up there.
Sentence 59: Then they also propose to put on the shelf this legislative program of reciprocal trade treaties.
Sentence 60: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 61: That is the most terrible thing of the whole business.
Sentence 62: Our foreign policy and the European recovery program, and everything else, is based on that trade treaty agreement.
Sentence 63: You said there are 700 postmasters--maybe 900.
Sentence 64: They are all appointed under civil service examination, under a law that the Congress itself has always followed.
Sentence 65: I don't know what they have got against these postmasters.
Sentence 66: All of them are acting postmasters now.
Sentence 67: Q.
Sentence 68: I guess what they have got against them is the provision that was written in, virtually giving them the appointment for life when they get confirmed.
Sentence 69: They didn't used to be but 4-year terms.
Sentence 70: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 71: I don't know whether that is so or not.
Sentence 72: I can't tell you how it is done.
Sentence 73: That's their own business, but they aren't doing the business of the Government any good, so far as efficiency is concerned.
Sentence 74: [7.]
Sentence 75: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us what you discussed with Senator Tobey?
