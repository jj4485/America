Sentence 1: 1947 The Presidents News Conference 414

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have no special announcements to make this morning, but I thought maybe you might want to ask me some questions and I will answer them if I can.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: Q. Mr. President, when the White House announced yesterday that you and Mrs. Truman had decided to cancel state dinners in order to conserve food, is there any attempt to have that as a national example, your action?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 5: NO, not necessarily.
Sentence 6: It was a voluntary procedure on our part.
Sentence 7: We will have the receptions as usual.
Sentence 8: The idea was that we could probably save a good deal of food by canceling the state dinners for this season, as we did during the war, but that doesn't make it incumbent upon anybody else to make any cancellations unless they desire to do so.
Sentence 9: I know what you are interested in--you are interested in that photographers' dinner that you have been getting ready for some time.
Sentence 10: [Laughter] As long as they comply with the rules of food conservation, I see no reason why they shouldn't go ahead with the dinner, if they want to.
Sentence 11: [2.]
Sentence 12: Q. Mr. President, Governor Blue of Iowa sent a message to you on the food situation, in reply to your message to all the Governors.
Sentence 13: I have been asked to inquire whether you have any comment on it?
Sentence 14: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 15: Well, I have had replies from 23 or 24 Governors.
Sentence 16: They have been coming in right straight along, and I haven't had a chance to read all of them as yet.
Sentence 17: I remember, though, that the Governor's message was one of them and that it was cooperative.
Sentence 18: All of them have been cooperative, which makes me believe that the food program is well on the way to success.
Sentence 19: Q. Mr. President, I have been trying to rationalize this food thing, especially this morning at breakfast without any egg, but I wondered are you going to have the chickens not eat any grain the seventh day of the week?
Sentence 20: How are you going to save that grain?
Sentence 21: That is going to mean more grain unless you cut down the flocks.
Sentence 22: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 23: The Citizens Food Committee is in conference now with the poultrymen and with the feed men.
Sentence 24: What we are after is grain.
Sentence 25: We are trying to raise million bushels of grain to feed starving people over the next 6 months.
Sentence 26: Q.
Sentence 27: I understand that.
Sentence 28: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 29: That is what we are after.
Sentence 30: We are trying to find a practical way to do it.
Sentence 31: Now we have to make this program--it was an emergency with which we were faced, and under ordinary conditions we would have worked out the program more deliberately and have consulted these people in advance.
Sentence 32: As it was, we had to work out the program and then find out where the "bugs" were and remedy that if it is necessary.
Sentence 33: What we are after is grain for the hungry people, and I know it is a--sometimes we feel like we have been imposed upon, but this is an attempt to get this free enterprise Nation to do voluntarily what other nations have to do by police state methods, and that we don't want to do.
Sentence 34: Q.
Sentence 35: Well then, trying to reason this out, it seemed to me that what you would do is decrease the market for chickens and eggs to the point where you would lower the number in the flocks.
Sentence 36: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 37: Well, what we are trying to do is, over a certain period of time, is save a certain amount of grain.
Sentence 38: Now we have got the distillers and the bakery people, and everybody else--the restaurant people and everybody--trying to help us do that job.
Sentence 39: Now if they will tell us some way to save grain, I have no objection to any method that will save the grain to get to these hungry people.
Sentence 40: I am trying to keep people from starving to death this winter, that's all.
Sentence 41: Q. Mr. President, if you ate more poultry, wouldn't you have fewer chickens to eat the grain?
Sentence 42: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 43: Now that's like which came first, the chicken or the egg.
Sentence 44: Can't answer a question like that.
Sentence 45: Can't answer that question.
Sentence 46: What I am trying to do is prevent grain, that should go to feed hungry people, from being fed to chickens and livestock for a certain period of time.
Sentence 47: If we can get that 100 million bushels of grain, then we can go on almost as usual.
Sentence 48: Q.
Sentence 49: I should assume by this statement that if you find out that there are some deviations in this program which will do better, you wouldn't object to changing the program?
Sentence 50: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 51: Well now, that's a matter that I am letting the Citizens Food Committee work out the best way that they know how.
Sentence 52: We have got some very able people on that committee, and they are holding conferences every day.
Sentence 53: Certain other people are trying to get this thing to work-some way to get the grain.
Sentence 54: That is what we are after.
Sentence 55: We are interested in grain to feed hungry people.
Sentence 56: [3.]
Sentence 57: Q. Mr. President, have you, after these various food conservation measures and also reports of several financial plans-do you believe now that this stopgap aid for Europe can be provided without a special session of Congress?
Sentence 58: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 59: I can't answer that question now.
Sentence 60: We are still working on it.
Sentence 61: We are still trying to find the funds for the stopgap aid, but that doesn't necessarily mean that there won't have to be a special session if it becomes necessary, as I have always told you.
Sentence 62: Not hesitate to call one.
Sentence 63: Q. Have you had any success in finding those funds, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: Yes, we have had considerable success in finding funds.
Sentence 65: We have got the Export-Import Bank to release some of its regulations on this last 93 or 98 million dollars, whatever it was, that France still had coming on their loan; and we found this $50 million that was owing to them-France says we owe them--bought francs-so that France would have the dollars to spend.
Sentence 66: We are making every effort in other directions, which I will report to you as they come along.
Sentence 67: Q.
Sentence 68: There is still a possibility of a special session coming along?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 69: Of course there is.
Sentence 70: [4.]
Sentence 71: Q.
Sentence 72: Do you intend to make public General Wedemeyer's report on China?
Sentence 73: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: General Marshall will have a statement to make on that in a few days.
Sentence 75: The report was made to General Marshall.
Sentence 76: [5.]
Sentence 77: Q. Mr. President, after a test run of this food conservation campaign, and if it fails, will you have other measures like restoring controls?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: That matter--we will cross that bridge when we come to it.
Sentence 79: [6.]
Sentence 80: Q. Mr. President, what do you think about Mr. Wallace's speech, on Cabinet being Wall Street men?
Sentence 81: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 82: I have no comment to make on that.
Sentence 83: [7.]
Sentence 84: Q. Mr. President, are you prepared yet to name the advisory panel in the Federal Mediation Service?
Sentence 85: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 86: I will be prepared in a few days to name that panel.
Sentence 87: I will announce it to you just as soon as it is ready.
Sentence 88: [8.]
Sentence 89: Q. Mr. President, I want to ask you a question as former Chairman of the Truman Investigating Committee.
Sentence 90: We have a situation in Washington which involves the death of a man
1
--a very unfortunate prisoner--who died as a result of injuries from police custody.
Sentence 91: There are charges of police negligence.
Sentence 92: The chairman of the Senate District Committee intimates that he may have an investigation by that committee.
Sentence 93: Do you have any comment on a situation like that, or do you think that the District of Columbia authorities should wait for an investigation by the Senate in a case involving.
Sentence 94: 1
John Forrest Bunch.
Sentence 95: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: I have no comment.
Sentence 97: That is a local municipal matter, which should be handled in the proper way by the proper authorities.
Sentence 98: I have no comment on that.
Sentence 99: [9.]
Sentence 100: Q. Mr. President, what about the Krug report, which has been over here about 10 days?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: The Krug report will be released in a few days, as soon as we are ready.
Sentence 102: I want to read it carefully myself before I release it.
Sentence 103: 1
1
See Item 212.
Sentence 104: [10.]
Sentence 105: Q. Mr. President, have you read Mr. Byrnes's new book?
2
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 106: Not entirely, no.
Sentence 107: I have read some of it--extracts from it--but I haven't read it carefully.
Sentence 108: 2
James F. Byrnes, "Speaking Frankly," New York: Harper and Brothers, 1947.
Sentence 109: Q.
Sentence 110: What do you think of what you have read, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: I have no comment.
Sentence 112: [11.]
Sentence 113: Q. Mr. President, in counterposing voluntary methods of saving food to police state methods--a few minutes ago--do you mean to suggest that consumer rationing would be a police state method?
Sentence 114: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 115: Why necessarily.
Sentence 116: Anything that you have to enforce by police methods is a police state method.
Sentence 117: I remember all the argument about taking off price controls, and voluntary saving, and all that sort of thing, that prices wouldn't go up.
Sentence 118: Don't you remember all that conversation about what would happen when we got rid of price controls ?
Sentence 119: Most interesting history, if you want to go back a little into it.
Sentence 120: Q.
Sentence 121: The Star had a very interesting table on that last night, showing that prices had risen from 8 to 80 percent on meat.
Sentence 122: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 123: That's right.
Sentence 124: I have some very interesting figures on that myself.
Sentence 125: I try to keep up with these things.
Sentence 126: There is a graph--[taking one out of his desk and indicating ]--right there that shows the situation.
Sentence 127: Most interesting.
Sentence 128: Q. Mr. President, if everybody is for this export relief of food abroad, you wouldn't have such high prices, would you?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 129: Yes, it would be just the same high prices.
Sentence 130: The export--that is a piece of misinformation.
Sentence 131: The effect, of course, of large purchases in any market has a tendency to raise that price a small amount.
Sentence 132: But it is a very small percentage of the grain crop in this country that goes for exports.
Sentence 133: There has been a tremendous amount of gambling on those commodity exchanges, both in food and fiber.
Sentence 134: That is what causes high prices principally in the food products.
Sentence 135: Q. Mr. President, this wheat crop is 1,400 million bushels--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 136: Yes, it has been--it has been--
Q.--over a third'-
THE PRESIDENT.--that wheat crop has been traded in about 8 or 9 times--8 or 9 billion bushels have been traded in on the Chicago Board of Trade alone.
Sentence 137: Now you can put that down for what it's worth, because about exports--the exports are not out of line with what it has always been.
Sentence 138: We have always exported a third or more of our wheat crop.
Sentence 139: Q. Mr. President, since the higher margins were put on the grain exchanges, prices have continued to go up.
Sentence 140: Do you think they should be still higher than they are?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 141: I don't know.
Sentence 142: We will have to wait and see how they are going.
Sentence 143: They haven't had a chance to work completely yet.
Sentence 144: Haven't been in force long enough.
Sentence 145: [12.]
Sentence 146: Q. Is there any intention in the administrative side of the Government to investigate this gambling on the food exchanges ?
Sentence 147: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 148: Yes, we are having it looked into.
Sentence 149: Q.
Sentence 150: By whom?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 151: By the Attorney General.
Sentence 152: Q. Mr. President, on this gambling in fiber also, are there investigations into cotton and wool trading too?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 153: No, there hasn't been, so far.
Sentence 154: Q. Well, that is on the--the Attorney General's investigation is in food and fiber?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 155: Food and fiber, yes.
Sentence 156: This thing covers the whole ground.
Sentence 157: Q.
Sentence 158: The grand jury that has now been in session in Chicago, or is it a separate investigation into the grain exchange?
Sentence 159: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 160: You would have to ask the Attorney General about that, because I don't run the details.
Sentence 161: You ask the Attorney General.
Sentence 162: Q. Mr. President, what I was getting at is whether you had requested a specific investigation of the grain exchanges?
Sentence 163: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 164: No, the Attorney General took it up on his own initiative, which was right in his department, and should have been done.
Sentence 165: Q. Deals with what you have called gambling on the exchanges ?
Sentence 166: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: That's right.
Sentence 168: Q. Does livestock come in on that, sir?
Sentence 169: I think a few of these questions included something about meat.
Sentence 170: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 171: NO.
Sentence 172: No, these--they don't come in on that.
Sentence 173: You don't have commodity exchanges in livestock.
Sentence 174: The prices of livestock usually are set in the five market centers--in Chicago, St. Paul, Omaha, Fort Worth, and Kansas City.
Sentence 175: Q. Mr. President, there has already been a grand jury investigation of the meat packers in Chicago?
Sentence 176: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 177: That's right.
Sentence 178: [13.]
Sentence 179: Q. Mr. President, has the decision been made yet whether the United States will take over the British Zone of operations in Germany?
Sentence 180: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 181: No.
Sentence 182: No decision has been made on that.
Sentence 183: [14.]
Sentence 184: Q. Mr. President, can we get back a minute to this business of consumer rationing and the police state?
Sentence 185: Did I understand you correctly, sir, to say that you thought that consumer rationing and price controls were methods of a police state ?
Sentence 186: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 187: Yes, they are.
Sentence 188: Anything you have to enforce and punish people for infringing is a police state approach.
Sentence 189: Q.
Sentence 190: That is true of the Office of Price Administration, then--is it ?
Sentence 191: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 192: Yes, it had to be.
Sentence 193: It was the only way you could make it work.
Sentence 194: Under the emergency we have to assume those controls.
Sentence 195: But I was told, I think very vociferously, that this is a free country, that we wouldn't suffer from any of the things that we are now suffering from, if we took price controls off right away.
Sentence 196: Q.
Sentence 197: But you don't consider you will have to reimpose them at this point?
Sentence 198: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 199: I can't answer that.
Sentence 200: You will have to see how the situation works.
Sentence 201: Q.
Sentence 202: That was true of rent controls, too, was it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 203: Yes.
Sentence 204: [15.]
Sentence 205: Q.
Sentence 206: The other day the Vice Chairman of the Commodity Credit Corporation was in here.
Sentence 207: Can you tell us whether any decision has been reached on using the CCC funds ?
Sentence 208: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 209: NO, I can't answer that now.
Sentence 210: I will make an announcement on it whenever we can.
Sentence 211: [16.]
Sentence 212: Q. Mr. President, did you say that there was--I didn't hear very clearly-did you say that there was a grand jury investigation of this gambling on the exchange?
Sentence 213: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 214: Yes.
Sentence 215: Q.
Sentence 216: Just the Attorney General ?
Sentence 217: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 218: The Attorney General is making the investigation.
Sentence 219: I don't know how he is doing it.
Sentence 220: You will have to ask him.
Sentence 221: [17.]
Sentence 222: Q. To clear up one thing that was asked, would that likewise apply to direct controls--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 223: Any control enforced by the state is a police method of getting the job done.
Sentence 224: And of course it has to be done in any emergency, and everybody agrees to do it.
Sentence 225: But in a free country like this it wants to be done under the agreement of all the people, and not at the behest of just one
Q. In other words, both methods have their application according to the times, is that right, Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 226: That's right.
Sentence 227: It depends on the emergency.
Sentence 228: Reporter:
Sentence 229: Thank you, Mr. President.
