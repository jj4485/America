THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have got very few questions that I can adequately reply to.
Sentence 3: SECRETARY OF LABOR
I have one in connection with the Secretaryship of Labor.
Sentence 4: Secretary Davis is going to continue in office for the present, so that speculation on that is premature.
Sentence 5: MASSACHUSETTS TERCENTENARY COMMISSION
I have another question relating to the Commission for Celebration of the Tercentenary of the Founding of the Colony of Massachusetts.
Sentence 6: I have today requested Governor Alvan T. Fuller, ex-Governor Channing Cox, Miss Mary Emma Woolley, of Mt. Holyoke, James Phelan, of Boston, and John Richardson of Boston, to become the public members of the Commission.
Sentence 7: And that is all I have got.
