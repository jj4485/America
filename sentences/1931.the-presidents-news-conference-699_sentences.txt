Sentence 1: 1931 The Presidents News Conference 699

THE BUDGET
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: At the Cabinet meeting this morning, its session was devoted to the consideration of expenditure for the next fiscal year.
Sentence 3: They had before them the compilations of the budget on a functional basis as has been customary for the last 2 years, and I thought perhaps you might want to see it.
Sentence 4: If you will look at it you will see that the expenditures for the present fiscal year are about $4,435 million as compared with $4,994 [$3,994] million for the last fiscal year and $4,119 million for the next fiscal year, that is the appropriations for the next fiscal year.
Sentence 5: And in all of these tables the Post Office is included only as to the deficit--not as to the working expenditure or working basis.
Sentence 6: The budget for by the increased employment and the whole of these years, of course, is greatly increased expenditures on construction work, in relief of unrelief to agriculture, and by the increase in expenditures on veterans, and as against that there have been some reductions of expenditures in other directions.
Sentence 7: The heading of "Public Buildings and Public Works," this item 31, which amounts to $434 million for this present fiscal year and $458 million for the next fiscal year includes the highways, but it does not include the construction expenditures of the Army and Navy or military structures.
Sentence 8: It does not include the merchant marine loans to the Shipping Board or construction for aviation and park improvements and other minor items.
Sentence 9: Those are distributed by the budget over other items.
Sentence 10: A total of all construction work including these items are now progressing, as you know, at the rate of about $725 million a year or somewhere about $500 million a year in excess of the rate under predepression conditions.
Sentence 11: The expenditure shown as aids to agriculture is item no. 26.
Sentence 12: The total for this year of $341 million includes farm relief and Farm Board expenditures, together with the other expenditures of the Department of Agriculture, but does not include the highways, which is under "Public Works."
Sentence 13: The expenditures on veterans' relief, which appear in items 11 and 12 show an increase for this fiscal year of about $190 million, but that includes $112 million of normal payment on the bonus fund, which was advanced by Congress from the next fiscal year budget for the present fiscal year.
Sentence 14: The statement does not cover the loans made on the bonus.
Sentence 15: They are represented there in the budget as $112 million a year of regular payments into that account.
Sentence 16: The loans on the certificates necessarily affect Treasury business, and for your information, General Hines informs me that the new loans made under the recent law, together with those already outstanding under the old law, now amount to $912 million.
Sentence 17: And in addition to this, the applications in hand which they have not yet reached amount to about $140 million more, making a total expenditure already in sight on loans to veterans on the bonus certificates of something about $1,050 million.
Sentence 18: Of course, the applications are still coming in.
Sentence 19: That latter figure corroborates the estimates we made at the time the act was passed.
Sentence 20: I have no doubt you might find something in here that may be of interest to you.
Sentence 21: I cannot add much more to it.
Sentence 22: QUESTIONS
Q.
Sentence 23: Mr. President, is there anything in there--I am trying to figure out on what the deficit was based.
Sentence 24: Did you get the deficit by taking $4,119 million from $4,435 million ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: No, this is wholly expenditures.
Sentence 26: There are no receipts.
Sentence 27: We are not able to make any calculation on receipts or revenues.
Sentence 28: This relates solely to the expenditures.
Sentence 29: Q. Mr. President, the June 30, 1931, expenditures are represented as estimates.
Sentence 30: Aren't they amounts already appropriated ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 31: These budget matters of appropriation or expenditure do not always run accurately with appropriations.
Sentence 32: Of course, we are always striving to get below the appropriations where we can do it without injuring the major purpose of the appropriations themselves.
Sentence 33: The estimate for June 1931 would be as at the middle of this month, so there are 2Â½ months to run, and therefore, they are given as estimates rather than the actual fact.
Sentence 34: Q. Mr. President, there is considerable of a cut there as between the figures for 1931 and 1932.
Sentence 35: Could you indicate where the economies come in?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 36: Well, you can run down between '31 and '32--public debt charges are much the same--about $8 million increase.
Sentence 37: The War Department expenditure shows a decrease of $12 million.
Sentence 38: The Navy Department shows an increase of about $25 million.
Sentence 39: The veterans' services show a decrease of $203 million.
Sentence 40: A good part of that is due to the shift, however, of $112 million from next year into this year.
Sentence 41: Then there is a decrease of about $10 million in the estimated postal deficit.
Sentence 42: There is a decrease in agricultural aids from $341 million to $160 million showing thereby a saving there of about $180 million.
Sentence 43: Q. Mr. President, that saving on agriculture--is that doing away with State assistance?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: No, it has to do with the appropriations for farm relief.
Sentence 45: I think the appropriations were $200 million or thereabouts in the present fiscal year and $100 million for next year, and the drought relief is in this year's budget and not in next year's.
Sentence 46: Q. Mr. President, on the items of veterans' relief.
Sentence 47: You said that the loans would amount to $1,050 million ultimately.
Sentence 48: How is that $112 million in that accounted for ?
Sentence 49: How do we account for that ?
Sentence 50: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 51: Those are loans.
Sentence 52: They have to be arranged by corresponding loans from the Treasury.
Sentence 53: Q. Will it appear, Mr. President, in the figure in the debt ?
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: It will be in the figure in the debt.
Sentence 56: Q. Mr. President, am I right in believing that General Hines estimated that $1 billion would be the total required ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 57: His estimate was that the total would be a minimum of $1 billion.
Sentence 58: Q.
Sentence 59: That includes past loans ?
Sentence 60: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 61: Yes, it is $1,050 million.
Sentence 62: Q. Isn't there $700 million in the Treasury to meet that ?
Sentence 63: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: Yes, the previous annual payments for the bonus will aggregate about $750 million as I recollect--something about that figure.
Sentence 65: When it is paid out of cash it has to be borrowed from somewhere.
Sentence 66: Q. Mr. President, is there any comparison between this 1932 expenditure and the amount appropriated by Congress for this purpose?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: These are based upon appropriations.
Sentence 68: Q.
Sentence 69: These are actual appropriations?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: Yes.
Sentence 71: Q. Mr. President, what big general lesson would you draw from these figures ?
Sentence 72: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 73: Nothing but public information.
Sentence 74: Q.
Sentence 75: These figures indicate that the fiscal year 1932 will be less than that for June 1931 ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: Yes, and with the constant striving to reduce expenditures wherever we can, we are going into the necessary aid to unemployment, agriculture, et cetera--we may get it even less than this.
Sentence 77: Q.
Sentence 78: You do not estimate any unusual expenditure to narrow that gap ?
Sentence 79: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 80: No, unless we get it from Congress.
