THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: Byron Price has agreed to go to Germany in an advisory capacity on public relations.
Sentence 5: He is going with the approval of General Eisenhower and General Clay, and I am very happy that he is going, because I think he can be a great deal of help to that situation over there.
Sentence 6: [2.]
Sentence 7: In yesterday's report which I handed to you I did not know at the time, because I hadn't had time to read it completely myself, that there had been some aspersions cast on Cordell Hull.

Sentence 9: [3.]
Sentence 10: Ambassador Pauley this afternoon will hold a press conference at 3 p.m. on the reparations situation.

Sentence 17: Q. In a magazine article you wrote, or that appeared under your name, when you were a Senator--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 18: Things come back to haunt you!
Sentence 19: [Laughter]
Q.--you said Admiral Kimmel and General Short were not on speaking terms.
Sentence 20: Admiral Kimmel subsequently said that was a false statement.
Sentence 21: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 22: Apparently, according to this report, it was not a statement of fact.
Sentence 23: I was speaking with the best information I had at the time.
Sentence 24: Q. Mr. President, was there any reason for putting out the report on the day that we entered Tokyo?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: No, no reason except that there was so much conversation about it; there was no ulterior motive to it.
Sentence 26: Q. Mr. President, despite what you said yesterday, there are some very strong reports on the Hill and elsewhere that you are going to order the Army and Navy to institute a court-martial proceeding against certain people.
Sentence 27: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 28: I am not.
Sentence 29: The matter has not been brought up to me.
Sentence 30: I don't think I have authority to order a court-martial.
Sentence 31: I think it has to go through a form of procedure set up by Congress.
Sentence 32: Q.
Sentence 33: There is a lot of talk that indicates some of them think the gentlemen, mentioning General Short and Admiral Kimmel, should have a court-martial if for no other reason than to make their side public.
Sentence 34: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 35: If they want it, I have no objection to it.
Sentence 36: I want everybody to be fairly treated.
Sentence 37: Q.
Sentence 38: You would like to see those fellows make their statement ?
Sentence 39: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 43: Q. Representative May represented the reports as a "whitewash."
Sentence 44: Do you agree with that?
Sentence 45: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 46: I don't.
Sentence 47: I don't think Representative May read the report.
Sentence 48: [Laughter] If you read them very carefully, they are not a "whitewash.
Sentence 49: "
Q. In that same article you discussed your feeling for need of unity of command.
Sentence 50: In the light of these new reports is there anything more you would like to say about that?
Sentence 51: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 64: [8.]
Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, is there anything you can tell us about the general plans on what we are going to do to feed Europe this winter, now that lend-lease is--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: I can't give you the details on that.
Sentence 67: The plans are being studied and worked on.
Sentence 68: As soon as the British representatives come here from Great Britain I think we will work out a plan that will be satisfactory to all concerned.
Sentence 69: Q.
Sentence 70: You mean there will be an interim period between now and the time when the Bretton Woods monetary agreement begins?
Sentence 71: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 93: [12.]
Sentence 94: Q.
Sentence 95: If we may return to the Pearl Harbor report for a moment, it seems to me that anyone who tries to make that clear to himself has a very tough time clarifying such things as why, when Stimson reported that they had told Hull that the Army and Navy wanted 3 months more time, they didn't know about it, and why, when Hull had broken with these people, that information was not relayed to Hawaii.
Sentence 96: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: I wasn't here then.
Sentence 98: Q. No, but I wondered if you were clear in your own mind.
Sentence 99: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: I have read it very carefully, and I came to the conclusion that the whole thing is the result of the policy which the country itself pursued.
Sentence 101: The country was not ready for preparedness.
Sentence 102: Every time the President made an effort to get a preparedness program through Congress, it was stifled.
Sentence 103: Whenever the President made a statement about the necessity of preparedness, he was vilified for doing it.
Sentence 104: I think the country is as much to blame as any individual in this final situation that developed in Pearl Harbor.

Sentence 112: Q. Is that for the benefit of both radio and press?
Sentence 113: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 114: Everything that has to do with public relations.
Sentence 115: Q. Does that apply to Great Britain?
Sentence 116: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: And to the United States also.
Sentence 118: [14.]
Sentence 119: Q. Mr. President, there is one thing in the Army and Navy Board reports about Marshall and Stark telling President Roosevelt they were not ready for war in November, and the Army report says that was transmitted November 27.
Sentence 120: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 121: I only know what I see in the report.
Sentence 122: Q. Mr. President, that's what made me think a court-martial would help to lay the whole thing out.
Sentence 123: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 124: It might--it might.
Sentence 125: I have no objection to a courtmartial, but I don't intend to order one.
Q.
Sentence 126: Any reason now why the whole Roberts committee report
1
should not be released?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 127: Only that there is still some information that should not be divulged that has nothing to do with the Pearl Harbor situation.
Sentence 128: It is the system by which we get information.
Sentence 129: We need that source of information now as we needed it then.
Sentence 130: 1

Sentence 135: The lieutenant who said "Forget it" is a lieutenant colonel.

Sentence 137: Is he?
Sentence 138: I didn't know that.
Sentence 139: [15.]

Sentence 142: I will let you know about it when I get it ready.
Sentence 143: [16.]
Sentence 144: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us further about the interim plan you have in mind between lend-lease and--which departments are working on it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: State, FEA, and War Department.
Sentence 146: [17.]
Sentence 147: Q. Mr. President, do you have any idea when the 52 pages deleted from the Army report will be made public?

THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 149: 2

Sentence 154: [18.]
Sentence 155: Q. Did Mme.

Sentence 159: Thank you, Mr. President.
