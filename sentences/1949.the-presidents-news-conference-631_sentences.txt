Sentence 1: 1949 The Presidents News Conference 631

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I have no announcements to make, gentlemen, except that I want to clear up just one thing, and that is in regard to the procedure of the Ways and Means Committee.
Sentence 4: There has been a lot of speculation on the Ways and Means Committee--Ways and Means Committee and the President on procedure.
Sentence 5: The Ways and Means Committee have been proceeding exactly as I have requested them to proceed.
Sentence 6: I asked them, in the first place, to consider social security ahead of taxes, and that is the reason they are doing it.
Sentence 7: Q. Mr. President, Governor Dever was in here a couple of weeks ago and indicated that you favored a special inquiry by the Ways and Means Committee in the domestic watch situation.
Sentence 8: Is that a correct interpretation--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 9: The matter was placed before me by the Waltham Watch Company and two or three other American watch companies.
Sentence 10: I made no comment on the situation, except to take the papers which they gave me and told them I would look into it.
Sentence 11: [2.]
Sentence 12: Q. Mr. President, there is a report that the administration is going to propose home relief funds in the social security program.
Sentence 13: Anything to that?
Sentence 14: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 15: No.
Q.
Sentence 16: What kind of funds, sir, did he ask?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 17: Home relief funds.
Sentence 18: I don't know what that means, but go ahead and explain it to him, Tony.

Anthony H. Leviero of the New York Times.
Sentence 19: Q. People out of work, getting support from the local communities.
Sentence 20: Story out of New York, that's the reason.
Sentence 21: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 22: Never heard of it.
Sentence 23: [3.]
Sentence 24: Q. Mr. President, your military aide, Gen. Harry Vaughan, has been the recipient of a considerable amount of criticism in connection with the decoration offered to him by the Government of Argentina.
Sentence 25: 2
He has been singled out for criticism, although a medal--that medal and other medals under similar circumstances have been offered to other officials and other officers.
Sentence 26: Have you any comment on why he should be criticized?
Sentence 27: Any comment on that?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 28: No reason in the world why he should be criticized.
Sentence 29: Stanley Woodward informed me the other day--just accidentally happened to inform me that he has more than a hundred--two or three--over there in his drawer that have been presented to nearly every--every general and admiral that we have got here in Washington, and more than twenty of these--this same medal that General Vaughan received, in that drawer, and various other generals and admirals in the service of the United States Government.
Sentence 30: There wasn't a thing in the world wrong with it.
Sentence 31: It was handled strictly according to law.
Sentence 32: And the only reason for the squawk is because General Vaughan happens to be my military aide.
Sentence 33: 2
Medal of the Order of San Martin.
Sentence 34: Q.
Sentence 35: They are gunning for you over his shoulder?
Sentence 36: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 37: That's it.
Sentence 38: Q. You mean, Mr. President, these generals don't pick up these decorations after they receive them?
Sentence 39: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 40: They do not.
Sentence 41: It's the specific--the law is specific on it, that those decorations are to be--not to be received individually until they receive permission from Congress to get them.
Sentence 42: That's the--in the criminal code--in the United States Code, not the criminal code--United States Code.
Sentence 43: During wartime it was allowed by the Congress by specific law that the military services could receive--and civilians, too--could receive decorations from our Allies or associated powers in the World War.
Sentence 44: That period expired on the 30th
day of last June, and the civil code went into effect at that time.
Sentence 45: [4.]
Sentence 46: Q. Mr. President, there is a good deal of discussion up on the Hill this week about the North Atlantic Pact.
Sentence 47: I wonder if you will give us some of your ideas about it?
Sentence 48: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 49: My ideas were very clearly and specifically expressed by the Secretary of State yesterday after an interview with me.
Sentence 50: 3
There isn't anything mysterious about it at all.
Sentence 51: Resolution 239 was passed by the Senate and unanimously passed by the House.
Sentence 52: And I announced clearly in my message on the--in the inaugural message, and in various messages on it previous to that, our stand in connection with the Atlantic Pact.
Sentence 53: There is no confusion about it at all.
Sentence 54: 3
Secretary of State Acheson's statement is printed in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 20, p. 263).

Sentence 56: Yes sir.
Sentence 57: Yes, it does.
Sentence 58: [5.]
Sentence 59: Q. What is your reaction, Mr. President, to the story that Secretary Royall asked to have troops withdrawn from Japan--

Sentence 62: [6.]
Sentence 63: Q. Mr. President, in his letter of February 14 to Secretary Krug, Mr. Pace said the Central Arizona project does not meet with your program.
Sentence 64: Is that still your position?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 65: The Central Arizona project is under consideration by the Congress, and it hasn't been considered as--whether it's a part of the program or not.
Sentence 66: The water situation in Arizona and in California is in a serious situation.
Sentence 67: I myself have been making some personal investigations on the situation, with the idea to try to find more water for both of those States.
Sentence 68: Q. Mr. President, a subsequent letter to-Mr. Pace sent to Senator O'Mahoney has been interpreted by Arizona as a reversal of your position.
Sentence 69: Is that correct?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: My position has never been reversed.
Sentence 71: It has been the same all the time.
Sentence 72: Q.
Sentence 73: There is still considerable confusion--
THE PRESIDENT.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: I receive a regular monthly report.
Sentence 80: Q.
Sentence 81: Can you give us your estimate on what the business outlook is today?
Sentence 82: There is considerable apprehension, you know, about falling prices and unemployment.
Sentence 83: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: I think myself, personally, that the situation is nothing to be alarmed about.
Sentence 85: I think it's the leveling off that everybody has been wishing for.
Sentence 86: And I hope that is the case, and that we do not have another spiral in prices.
Sentence 87: [8.]
Sentence 88: Q. Mr. President, do you think-are you in favor of modifying consumer credit controls, under Regulation W?
4
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: No.
4
Regulation W, for the control of consumer credit, was originally issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 1941 (12 CFR part 112).
Sentence 90: Under Public Law 905, 80th Congress, the regulation would become inoperative after June 30, 1949.
Sentence 91: Q.
Sentence 92: You are not in favor of modifying--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 93: I am not considering it at the present time.
Sentence 94: If it becomes apparent that it should be modified, why it will be modified.
Sentence 95: [9.]
Sentence 96: Q. Mr. President, have you reached a decision on whether Dr. Bruce is going back to Argentina?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: He has been trying to resign ever since he has been down there.

Sentence 100: Q.
Sentence 101: The McGraw-Hill Publishing Company sent out a lot of releases and stuff today, and one of them indicated that Ralph Bunche would be the next American Ambassador to Russia.
Sentence 102: Is that news to you?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 103: Yes, that's news to me.
Sentence 104: Q.
Sentence 105: Any comment on it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 106: That's news to me.
Sentence 107: Q. Mr. President, while we are talking about Russia, have you made a decision yet about Bedell Smith?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: That decision will have to be made by General Smith himself.
Sentence 109: He is under treatment now, on account of his health, and I haven't had a conference with him lately.
Sentence 110: That is up to General Smith.
Sentence 111: Q.
Sentence 112: He is still at Walter Reed?
Sentence 113: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 114: I think that is correct.
Sentence 115: [11.]
Sentence 116: Q. Mr. President, would you care to say anything further on the subject of taxes?
Sentence 117: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 118: There's nothing further, after that message.
Sentence 119: Q. There is some speculation that since you have put social security ahead of taxes, taxes will have to be abandoned.
Sentence 120: Is that true?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 121: No, that is not true.
Sentence 122: My position is exactly as it was.
Sentence 123: It hasn't changed a bit.
Sentence 124: It's a matter of procedure-doesn't make any difference.
Sentence 125: Q. Mr. President, would you care to comment on why you asked them to follow that procedure, of social security first?
Sentence 126: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 127: Because they are not--we were not ready on the tax proposition as yet.
Sentence 128: Just a matter of keeping the Ways and Means Committee busy.
Sentence 129: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, are you--would you be considering a compromise on taxes below $4 billion?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 130: I made my statement to the Congress in my message.
Sentence 131: And it still stands.
Sentence 132: [12.]
Sentence 133: Q. Mr. President, there is considerable discussion about the secrecy of the trials--military trials in Munich.
Sentence 134: Have you any ideas on the secrecy of those trials?
Sentence 135: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 136: I don't know anything about it, Pete
5
The Constitution should follow the flag wherever it goes, and trials should be conducted as we usually conduct them in this country.
Sentence 137: That is my theory, and I am trying to enforce it.
Sentence 138: I don't know anything about this one to which you refer.
Sentence 139: 5
Raymond P. Brandt of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Sentence 140: [13.]
Sentence 141: Q. Mr. President, in the Senate today, Mr. Langer said that you have dropped all pretense of continuing bipartisan foreign policy.

Sentence 143: That is not true.
Sentence 144: Not a word of truth in that.
Sentence 145: [14.]
Sentence 146: Q. Mr. President, would you care to comment on the Loyalty Board's clearance of William Remington?
6
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 147: I think the Loyalty Board undoubtedly heard all the evidence and made the proper decision.
Sentence 148: That's all the comment I will have.
Sentence 149: That's what I set them up for.
Sentence 150: 6
On February 11 the Government's Loyalty Review Board rejected disloyalty charges brought against William Remington, Director of the Export Program Staff of the Department of Commerce, by Elizabeth Bentley.

Sentence 153: [15.]
Sentence 154: Q. Will you clear up the Constitution following the flag?
Sentence 155: Those spies were tried in this city, those Germans that landed on Long Island, under the greatest of secrecy.
Sentence 156: That was, I think--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 157: That was during wartime.
Sentence 158: Q.
Sentence 159: That was during wartime.
Sentence 160: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 161: Wartime precaution.
Sentence 162: Q. Yes, sir.
Sentence 163: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 164: Merely a wartime precaution had to be done that way.
Sentence 165: [16.]
Sentence 166: Q. Mr. President, I have been asked to ask you if you are opposed to building this Glacier View Dam in the Glacier National Park, which has caused a controversy between the Park Service and the Army Engineers?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: I can't remember enough about the case, Tony.
Sentence 168: 7
Sentence 169: That's the first I had heard of that controversy.
Sentence 170: Is that on the-that Hungry Horse Dam?

Sentence 171: Q.
Sentence 172: I think it's Flat Head Dam, or something.
Sentence 173: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 174: Flat Head River.
Sentence 175: But I think that one is the Hungry Horse.
Sentence 176: Q. First I heard about it was 10 minutes ago.
Sentence 177: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 178: Then I happen to know a little bit more about it than you do, Tony.
Sentence 179: [More laughter]
Sentence 180: [17.]
Sentence 181: Q. Mr. President, getting back to that other thing on the Constitution, is there not a comparable situation in Europe, where you have an occupied area--where you have saboteurs landing in Long Island in wartime?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: Yes, that is comparable.
Sentence 183: It is comparable to that, but I am very anxious that American citizens--I don't want to treat--I am very anxious that American citizens
Q.
Sentence 184: No American citizens are involved.
Sentence 185: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 186: Well, that's--then that's a different matter.
Sentence 187: I am speaking strictly of Americans under--no matter where they are, you ought to have the same privilege that you have at home, if you work for the Government.
Sentence 188: I don't care where you are, in the occupied areas, or the trial of these foreigners, it's comparable to that.
Sentence 189: Q. Mr. President, on the other hand, don't you think American justice should be full and open?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 190: Well, that's a matter for argument, I think, if it comes to spies in enemy countries.
Sentence 191: [18.]
Sentence 192: Q. Mr. President, what do you think of this controversy between certain reporters working in Japan and Secretary Royall, as to what he said, that we might have to pull out of Japan in case of war with Russia?
Sentence 193: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 194: That's not my controversy.
Sentence 195: I would talk to the Secretary for Army.
Sentence 196: Q.
Sentence 197: Do you think Japan would be a military asset, or a liability?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 198: I couldn't understand what you said?
Sentence 199: Q. I said do you think that Japan would be a military asset or--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 200: I have no comment to make on that.
Sentence 201: The policy on Japan is set and fixed, and it hasn't changed.
Sentence 202: There has never been any change in policy, nor is there any indication of a change in policy.
Sentence 203: [19.]
Sentence 204: Q.
Sentence 205: This is a local question, Mr. President.
Sentence 206: Philadelphia is having a transit strike that has everything tied up.
Sentence 207: Is there any law or provision under which you can intervene?

Sentence 210: [20.]
Sentence 211: Q. Mr. President, do you have the social security recommendations ready?

Sentence 213: I beg your pardon?
Sentence 214: Q.
Sentence 215: Your recommendations on social security?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 216: They are in the course of preparation, and as soon as possible we will have them ready.
Sentence 217: Q. Will it follow the plan of last May 24, in which you submitted a message to Congress outlining--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 218: That's right--I believe I referred specifically to it in the message--in the Message on the State of the Union, I think.
Sentence 219: [21.]
Sentence 220: Q. Mr. President, Senator Taft has said that the anti-inflation bill that went up the other day proposes a controlled economy.
Sentence 221: I was wondering if you have anything to say on that?
Sentence 222: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 223: I have no argument with Senator Taft.
Sentence 224: My views on the subject have been expressed in message after message to Congress.

Sentence 227: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 228: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 229: You're welcome.
