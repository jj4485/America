Sentence 1: 1930 The Presidents News Conference 776

FRANKLIN MOTT GUNTHER
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have two items here.
Sentence 3: One of them is that Mr. Gunther, who has been Minister to Egypt, is being transferred to Ecuador, in line with our general policy of filling the Latin American posts with career men who have had South American experience.
Sentence 4: EMPLOYMENT
The Department of Labor reports this morning that for the first time since the stock exchange crash the tide of employment is changed in the right direction--shows a very distinct increase in employment all over the country during the past 10 days.
Sentence 5: A report from the time of the crash down to about the 25th of December shows a continuous decrease in employment, and now the tide seems to have definitely turned the other way, and substantially so.
Sentence 6: Other than that I will leave you to the many other sources of news.
