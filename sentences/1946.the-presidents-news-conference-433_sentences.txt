Sentence 1: 1946 The Presidents News Conference 433

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have no announcements to make today, but I thought maybe you might want to ask me a question or two, and I had better let you in and let you ask them.
Sentence 3: So, fire away.
Sentence 4: [1.]
Sentence 5: Q. What assurances did you give Mr. Byrnes yesterday about the French loan and some increased shipments of wheat?

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: Just a moment.
Sentence 26: I finish up with Mr. Pauley and then I will talk to you about that.
Sentence 27: Mr. Pauley--I thought maybe you might ask me a question like that, and I just want to reiterate what I have said before to press conference, that Mr. Pauley is on in his capacity as Chief of the American Reparations Commission.
Sentence 28: The resources and industries of Manchuria and Korea are basic to the of any long-range plan for the peaceful economy of East Asia.
Sentence 29: Mr. Pauley's report on Japanese reparations, removals, is a splendid plan for immediate action, to utilize the productive ability of Manchuria and Korea.
Sentence 30: At the present time, however, we have little information on their current productive ability.
Sentence 31: Therefore, no final program of reparations for Japan can be evolved until we know more about the resources and industrial relations on the continent, particularly in Manchuria and Korea.
Sentence 32: Since both the Secretary of State and I consider this to be a matter of considerable importance, we have got Mr. Pauley to undertake this firsthand study of the situation in Manchuria and Korea.

Sentence 34: And that is substantially what was in my letter asking Mr. Pauley to continue this.

Sentence 61: Q.
Sentence 62: I was wondering if you could give us a slight hint on the Court appointment-tell us whether the Chief Justice is going to come from one of the present judges, or from outside?

Sentence 72: I have nothing further to say than what is in that statement.
Sentence 73: [10.]
Sentence 74: Q. Mr. President, will you allow Federal departments to bargain with unions whose constitutions permit strikes against the Government?
Sentence 75: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: I don't believe in strikes against the Government.
Sentence 77: I don't think it legal, or ever will be.
Sentence 78: Whenever they are, the Government will cease to exist.
Sentence 79: [11.]
Sentence 80: Q. Mr. President, in view of the renewed discussion of the possibility of rationing in the food crisis, could you update us a little on food, with particular reference to whether you now think rationing would be needed?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: Well, rationing at the present time would not meet the emergency, because there isn't time to implement it, as I have told you time and again.
Sentence 82: If there should be a disastrous crop failure, and it should become necessary for rationing, we will not hesitate to put it into effect.
Sentence 83: Q. Barring crop failure, then, you don't think it will be necessary in the future?
Sentence 84: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 94: [12.]
Sentence 95: Q. Mr. President, are you going to see the American fliers who have come here on behalf of Mikhailovitch?

Sentence 96: They have discussed the matter with my Military Aide, and that is as far as it will go.
Sentence 97: [13.]
Sentence 98: Q. Mr. President, may I ask you about that expediting committee for OPA?
Sentence 99: Is it now in existence?
Sentence 100: It was announced?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 127: Did you read the whole of Secretary Forrestal's testimony?
Sentence 128: Q.
Sentence 129: He is very much against the bill.
Sentence 130: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: He didn't say so.
Sentence 132: He didn't say so.
Sentence 133: Read it very carefully.
Sentence 134: Mr. Forrestal submitted his testimony to me before it was--before he gave it.
Sentence 135: And he has a perfect right to say what he did, and I authorized him to do it.
Sentence 136: [17.]
Sentence 137: Q. Mr. President, it has been thought that the Government may find it necessary to seize some of the wheat now held by elevators and mills.

Sentence 149: That's 2 months--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: Difficult to find the men to fill the jobs.
Sentence 151: Should we find somebody that we think is capable of taking the job, he has got a better job, or doesn't want to consider Government service.
Sentence 152: That has been true ever since the war ceased.
Sentence 153: The good men are flocking to private industry for bigger pay.
Sentence 154: It's the most difficult thing we have to face, is finding men for the places.
Sentence 155: [19.]
Sentence 156: Q. Mr. President, I am puzzled by your statement that Secretary--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 157: You shouldn't be.
Sentence 158: You shouldn't be.
Sentence 159: What I am going to ask you to do is read the statement.
Sentence 160: If you do that, you won't have any trouble.
Sentence 161: Q.
Sentence 162: He is not opposing the merger--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 163: He is not opposing the merger.
Sentence 164: Q. --or the bill?

Sentence 176: It was nothing unusual or out of the way at all.
Sentence 177: Q. Mr. President, the New York Times had a very detailed story in which they said that--in actual quotation marks--that you told Mr. Byrnes that the Cabinet had taken up the French loan and that wheat situation yesterday.
