1
Secretary Acheson's statement of February 9 is published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 20, p. 230).
Sentence 59: The statement referred to the trial of Jozsef Cardinal Mindszenty as a "conscienceless attack upon religious and personal freedom."
Sentence 60: The statement continued as follows:
"In their conduct of the case of Cardinal Mindszenty, the Hungarian authorities do not appear to have omitted any of the usual methods practiced by a police state.
Sentence 61: Such proceedings constitute not the administration of justice but wanton persecution.
Sentence 62: They have evoked universal condemnation, and the Hungarian Government must bear full responsibility for its action.
Sentence 63: "The cases of Cardinal Mindszenty and other Hungarian Church leaders are not isolated developments.
Sentence 64: During the past 2 years, with governmental Power entirely in the hands of the minority Communist party, the people of Hungary have been increasingly denied the exercise of fundamental human rights and freedoms.
Sentence 65: Parliamentary opposition, an element indispensable to the democratic process, has been ruthlessly eliminated, the totalitarian controls of state and party have been laid like a deadening hand upon every phase of daily personal existence, and the Hungarian people have been divested of any real independence.
Sentence 66: "The people of the United States, and, without question, peoples of other freedom-loving nations, are sickened and horrified by these developments and fully comprehend the threat they constitute to free institutions everywhere.
Sentence 67: "
Q. I supposed it had.
Sentence 68: I was going to ask you if anybody suggested that their attitude is in violation of certain treaties that might cause you to want to cut off relations?
Sentence 69: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: It has been stated that their action is in violation of certain treaties.
Sentence 71: It hasn't been carried out to the logical conclusion.
Sentence 72: I think the treatment of the Cardinal is infamous, and it will go down in history as one of the black spots on Hungary's historical career.
Sentence 73: Q.
Sentence 74: May I ask you--did I understand you to say that their action is in violation of treaties, or had been suggested?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 75: It has been suggested that it is in violation of treaties.
Sentence 76: I don't know whether it is or not.
Sentence 77: Q. Mr. President, you said, I think, that the treatment of the Cardinal is infamous, and then you went on to say you think it will go down in history as a blot on the nation which--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: Which carried on a kangaroo court like that.
Sentence 79: Q. Mr. President, you mean nation or government?
Sentence 80: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: The nation.
Sentence 82: The nation is responsible for its government.
Sentence 83: Q. Mr. President, in Earl Godwin's question, there was a reference to not only a violation of treaties but the suggestion of possibly breaking off relations.
Sentence 84: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 85: I said that that matter is being investigated.
Sentence 86: I have no more comment to make on it, because I don't know.
Sentence 87: The experts haven't reported to me yet.
Sentence 88: Q. Mr. President, may we quote the word "infamous"?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: Yes.
Sentence 90: Q. Also "black spot"?
Sentence 91: Q. Mr. President, when you said a nation is responsible for its government, do you think that is always true in a Communist movement today?
Sentence 92: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 93: I can't answer that intelligently, but in a police state the people are never really responsible for their government, and Hungary certainly is a police state.
Sentence 94: Q.
Sentence 95: That's right.
Sentence 96: Q. Mr. President, just to avoid any misunderstanding--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: In most any police state, the people are never responsible.
Sentence 98: Q.--just before we go on, did I understand you to say that the matter of possibly breaking off relations with Hungary is under study?
Sentence 99: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: No, you did not.
Sentence 101: Q.
Sentence 102: I thought that was what the question was?
Sentence 103: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: No, no.
Sentence 105: I did not say that Mr.--[pause]--Godwin --[laughter]--
Mr. Godwin: Godwin.
Sentence 106: THE PRESIDENT.--asked me the question if the action of the--in the trial of the Cardinal did interfere with treaties which various nations had with Hungary.
Sentence 107: I said that had been suggested but an investigation is being made; but I can't answer that question now.
Sentence 108: Q.
Sentence 109: That was the question I thought implied that.
Sentence 110: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: Well, he said would that go so far as to involve breaking off relations.
Sentence 112: That has not been under consideration.
Sentence 113: Q. Thank you for verifying it.
Sentence 114: Q.
Sentence 115: It has gotten a little mixed up here.
Sentence 116: You said that a nation is responsible for its government--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: Well, when you speak of a nation you speak of its government always.
Sentence 118: Q. Yes sir.
Sentence 119: Then--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: What else--what other way can you adopt to make a nation except
Q.
Sentence 121: I am not arguing with you, sir, I am just trying to get the record--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 122: That's what I mean--I am speaking of the government of the country of Hungary.
Sentence 123: It is a national government, undoubtedly, even if it is a police state.
Sentence 124: Q.
Sentence 125: You make a distinction then between the people, and the nation and the government?
Sentence 126: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 127: That's right.
Sentence 128: Q.
Sentence 129: The nation and the government are one?
Sentence 130: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: That's right, that's the way I look at it.
Sentence 132: The people are entirely distinct from that.
Sentence 133: I think if the people had their say, they wouldn't have that kind of government.
Sentence 134: [10.]
Sentence 135: Q. Mr. President, a suggestion has been made by the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Committee, I believe that is his position, that this country tell the world how many atomic bombs it now has.
Sentence 136: Would you state your position on that?
Sentence 137: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 138: The Chairman of the Atomic Energy Committee made no such statement.
Sentence 139: Categorically he told me yesterday that he made no such statement.
Sentence 140: And of course I am not in favor of disclosing that.
Sentence 141: It is not a matter for public discussion.
Sentence 142: Q. Did he tell you what he said, Mr. President?
Sentence 143: That was the impression gotten abroad that that was it?
Sentence 144: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: He said he had made no such statement as that, that he did not believe that way at all, and that that is a matter that is not for public discussion now.
Sentence 146: I don't want to comment on it at all.
Sentence 147: Q.
Sentence 148: I thought it was Senator McMahon that had made that statement?
Sentence 149: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: I don't know about that.
Sentence 151: I hadn't discussed it with him.
Sentence 152: Q. Chairman Lilienthal, isn't that right?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 153: That's correct.
Sentence 154: Q.
Sentence 155: You are referring to Lilienthal?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 156: To Lilienthal.
Sentence 157: I was referring to the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.
Sentence 158: [11.]
Sentence 159: Q. Mr. President, are you still hopeful of a $4 billion tax raise, in view of some of the developments on the Hill?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 160: Yes, I am.
Sentence 161: I am just as strong for it now as I was when I asked for it in the message.
Sentence 162: Q. Mr. President, if we should be heading into a recession of some kind, would you feel that that 4 billion tax increase would-as advised under those circumstances--be apt to be inflationary?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 163: Just as advisable then as now, for the simple reason that it doesn't affect the expenses of the Government, and we are trying to avoid a deficit.
Sentence 164: [12.]
Sentence 165: Q. Mr. President, are you going to speak at Trinity College in--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 166: I have been invited, but I made no appointment.
Sentence 167: [13.]

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 172: He hasn't asked for an interview.
Sentence 173: Reporter:
Sentence 174: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 175: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 176: You're welcome.
