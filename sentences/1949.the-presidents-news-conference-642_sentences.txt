Sentence 62: Q. Mr. President, Senator Hickenlooper has suggested that Mr. Lilienthal resign.
Sentence 63: 3
Would you comment on--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: I want to read you a statement, just before you start on that, that will answer a lot of your questions and eliminate a lot of confusion.
Sentence 65: [Reading]: "I personally know that the country's position--what the country's position on atomic energy is.
Sentence 66: We are making good progress.
Sentence 67: Our situation has been vastly improved in the last 2 years under the Atomic Energy Commission.
Sentence 68: I deplore the fact that relatively trivial items have been blown up to proportions that threaten the integrity of the program.
Sentence 69: 3
On May 22, 1949, Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper of Iowa, ranking minority member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and formerly its chairman, issued a statement to the press stating that the Atomic Energy Commission was "staggering under daily disclosure of evidence of incredible mismanagement" and calling for the resignation of the Chairman, David E. Lilienthal.
Sentence 70: An investigation by the Joint Committee followed.
Sentence 71: For the Joint Committee's report, "Investigation into the United States Atomic Energy Commission," dated October 13, 1949, see Senate Report 1169, parts I and 2 (81st Cong., 1st sees.).
Sentence 72: The report concluded that "the committee is satisfied that the investigation discloses no instance where the Commission violated the McMahon Act," and that the investigation, "while fruitless in proving the charges of incredible mismanagement,' has served to highlight the nature of our atomic project and its manifold problems and ramifications, and has further served to bring home to the people of the United States that in operations of such a unique character mistakes and errors of judgment are bound to occur.
Sentence 73: "
On November 23, 1949, the White House released the text of the President's letter accepting the resignation of Mr. Lilienthal as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.
Sentence 74: Mr. Lilienthal served in the post from October 28, 1946, when he was appointed by the President, until February 15, 1950, when his resignation became effective.
Sentence 75: "It is time people stopped getting hysterical when the word 'atom' is mentioned.
Sentence 76: The plain fact is that the atomic energy program is in good shape, and is in good hands.
Sentence 77: I hope the Commission will soon be able to get back to work, and that the atomic energy program will cease to be used for preelection campaigns.
Sentence 78: "I have every confidence in Mr. Lilienthal.
Sentence 79: "
I don't think I can say anything more emphatic than that.
Sentence 80: Does that answer your question?
Sentence 81: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, was that last sentence in the statement, or was that something you just added--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 82: That's in the statement--
Q.--confidence in Lilienthal?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 83: No, that's my own conversation.
Sentence 84: Q. Would you be good enough to repeat that, please?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 85: I have the utmost confidence in Mr. Lilienthal.
Sentence 86: He has made a good chairman, and I am satisfied with the way he has been handling things.
Sentence 87: Q. Will Mr. Ross have copies of this statement for us?
Sentence 88: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: I don't think he has, but we'll have copies made.
Sentence 90: Q. Mr. President, last summer, when the Congress was interested in the Communist matter, you said they were "red herrings."
Sentence 91: Do you feel that is applicable--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: The "red herring" was used in an entirely different connection, and it was exactly correct when it was used.
Sentence 93: Q.
Sentence 94: It would not apply to these circumstances?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 95: I don't know whether it does or not.
Sentence 96: Let's wait and see.
Sentence 97: Do you know what the definition of "red herring" is ?
Sentence 98: Q. No.
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 99: Some of you didn't seem to know.
Sentence 100: It is something that is blown up to take the place of something under cover that somebody else wants to do, that isn't exactly in the public interest.
Sentence 101: So you won't apply that term to this, yet.
Sentence 102: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 103: If the private power interests get more active, will you apply it--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: We will wait and see.
Sentence 105: Q. Mr. President, do you still favor full civilian control of atomic energy?
Sentence 106: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: I certainly do.
Sentence 108: [3.]
Sentence 109: Q. Mr. President, have you any comment to make on recommittal of the armed services pay bill?
Sentence 110: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: I am sorry that they recommitted it.
Sentence 112: I was very much--I would have been very highly pleased if it had passed.
Sentence 113: It had been worked on very carefully, and was a scientific approach to the service pay of the Army, Navy, and Air Corps.
Sentence 114: [4.]
Sentence 115: Q. Mr. President, are you considering Silliman Evans for the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board?
Sentence 116: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: No, I am not.
Sentence 118: [5.]
Sentence 119: Q. Mr. President, do you think there is any merit in the proposal that Congress should appropriate funds to finance presidential campaigns for both parties?
Sentence 120: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 121: That has been under discussion ever since I have been in the Senate, and I never did come to a conclusion on.
Sentence 122: it.
Sentence 123: Presidential campaigns have been very capably handled by the different political parties.
Sentence 124: Senator Hatch started to put that in the Hatch Act, but it didn't get in.
Sentence 125: Q.
Sentence 126: Do you think it might be a good time to put it in?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 127: I have no comment on the subject at all.
Sentence 128: [6.]
Sentence 129: Q. Mr. President, what do you think about the proposal of Representative Mills of Arkansas to expedite payment of corporate taxes?
Sentence 130: THE PRESIDENT, I am not entirely familiar with the subject.
Sentence 131: Congressman Mills has talked the matter over with me.
Sentence 132: It is under consideration in the Treasury.
Sentence 133: You will get an answer as soon as we have had a chance to analyze it.
Sentence 134: [7.]
Sentence 135: Q. Mr. President, the Congress this.. afternoon passed the District revenue bill,.
Sentence 136: and we understand that Senator Hunt has telephoned the White House and the Budget Bureau asking that action be completed on the bill before the end of this month, in order to save loss of a month's revenue.
Sentence 137: Have you got any comment on that?
Sentence 138: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 139: No comment.
Sentence 140: We always act on bills just as expeditiously as we can.
Sentence 141: [8.]
Sentence 142: Q. Mr. President, have you abandoned hope of passage this year of legislation increasing the tax rate?
Sentence 143: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 144: No, I have not.
Sentence 145: Q.
Sentence 146: May I have that question again?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 147: He wanted to know if I had abandoned hope of a tax increase, and I said no.
Q.
Sentence 148: It was mentioned by Mr. Lucas,

Senator Scott W. Lucas of Illinois, Senate majority leader.
Sentence 151: After an interview with Senator Lucas on May 24 the press reported that congressional leaders hoped to adjourn the current session by July 31, even if measures given high priority by the administration had to be postponed until the next session.
Sentence 152: Q.
Sentence 153: It was mentioned by Mr. Lucas.
Sentence 154: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 155: I had been in touch with Mr. Lucas, and he tells me that his complete interview was not published, that he had made the statement that there were a great many things before the Congress, and that it might be necessary to extend the session in order to complete the job which is now before them.
Sentence 156: And that is exactly what Sam Rayburn said, and I knew that they were in agreement because they were in agreement when they went out of here.
Sentence 157: [9.]
Sentence 158: Q. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question on statehood for Alaska and Hawaii.
Sentence 159: I believe you are already on record in favor of statehood for both of these territories?
Sentence 160: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 161: That is correct.
Sentence 162: Q. There is a report on the Hill this morning that you had asked the Rules Committee to report out a bill for statehood for Alaska without regard to Hawaii?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 163: That is not true.
Sentence 164: I asked for both of them.
Sentence 165: [10.]
Sentence 166: Q. Mr. President, can you give us any personal preference or priority on bills.

Sentence 170: Q. Can't get it all?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 171: No.
Sentence 172: We want to get as much as we can.

Sentence 181: Q. Mr. President, to clear it up, are you in favor of holding Congress in session--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: I think Congress ought to finish the job so far as it can; and I think it will.
Sentence 183: Q. Until the whole program--
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 185: Q. Is it possible to include enactment of--

Sentence 194: Q. Mr. President, what do you think of this Tydings resolution
5
for a 5 percent cut on all--
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 198: introduced May 19 by Senators Millard E. Tydings and Herbert R. O'Conor of Maryland and by Senator Clyde M. Reed of Kansas.
Sentence 199: This was one of a number of bills the general purpose of which was to reduce expenditures by providing for an across-the-board cut of 5 or 10 percent in each appropriation bill as enacted.
Sentence 200: Q. How about the ECA cut?

Sentence 203: [14.]
Sentence 204: Q. Mr. President, could you tell us that--a little more fully--specifically, how the tax legislation will get before the Congress at this session?

Sentence 208: I tell
them what I think the country ought to have, and it is up to the Congress to work it out.
Sentence 209: I can't run the legislative branch of the Government.
Sentence 210: It's none of my business.
Sentence 211: [15.]
Sentence 212: Q. Some of us got the rather firm impression from Senator Lucas the other morning that, aside from pending matters before the Congress, there were three matters that he said had ranking priority, one of which was labor, the other reciprocal trade, and the other was the North Atlantic Pact; that some of the other legislation on the program, such as taxes, such as national health insurance, might not get to the--
