Sentence 1: 1950 The Presidents News Conference 591

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: Please be seated, ladies and gentlemen.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: I have a statement that I want to read to you that probably will save you some questions.
Sentence 5: I will take it real slowly, because the mimeographed copies may not be over here as promptly as they should be, but they will be ready almost immediately after the conference.
Sentence 6: Q. Mr. President, if you get ahead of us, do you mind if we stop you?
Sentence 7: THE PRESIDENT, No, that's all right.
Sentence 8: [Reading ] "There have been new attacks within the past week against the Secretary of State, Mr. Acheson.
Sentence 9: I have been asked to remove him from office, and the authors of this suggestion claim that this would be good for the country."
Sentence 10: Q.
Sentence 11: You're ahead of me, sir.
Sentence 12: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 13: You're going to take it all down in longhand?
Sentence 14: Q. Worse than that, I'm practicing my new shorthand.
Sentence 15: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 16: [Reading] "The authors of this suggestion claim that this would be good for the country.
Sentence 17: "
That's all right--whenever I go too fast, I'll stop.
Sentence 18: [Reading] "How our position in the world would be improved by the retirement of Dean Acheson from public life is beyond me.
Sentence 19: Mr. Acheson has helped shape and carry out our policy of resistance to Communist imperialism.
Sentence 20: From the time of our sharing of arms with Greece and Turkey nearly 4 years ago, and coming down to the recent moment when he advised me to resist the Communist invasion of South Korea, no official in our Government has been more alive to communism's threat to freedom or more forceful in resisting it.
Sentence 21: "At this moment, he is in Brussels representing the United States in setting up a mutual defense against aggression.
Sentence 22: This has made it possible for me to designate General Eisenhower as Supreme Allied Commander in Europe.
Sentence 23: "If communism were to prevail in the world--as it shall not prevail--Dean Acheson would be one of the first, if not the first, to be shot by the enemies of liberty and Christianity.
Sentence 24: "These recent attacks on Mr. Acheson are old, in the sense that they are the same false charges" and I emphasize that false charges--"that have been made time and again over a period of months.
Sentence 25: They have no basis in fact whatever.
Sentence 26: "It is the same thing that happened to Seward.
Sentence 27: President Lincoln was asked by a group of Republicans to dismiss Secretary of State Seward.
Sentence 28: He refused.
Sentence 29: So do I refuse to dismiss Secretary Acheson.
Sentence 30: "If I did anything else, it would weaken the firm and vigorous position this country has taken against Communist aggression.
Sentence 31: "If those groups attacking our foreign policy and Mr. Acheson have any alternative policies to offer, they should disclose them.
Sentence 32: They owe it to the country.
Sentence 33: This is a time for hard facts and close thinking.
Sentence 34: It is not a time for vague charges and pious generalities.
Sentence 35: "There are some Republicans who recognize the facts and the true reasons for these attacks on Secretary Acheson, and who do not agree with their colleagues.
Sentence 36: "This Nation needs the wisdom of all its people.
Sentence 37: This is a time of great peril.
Sentence 38: It is a time for unity, and for real bipartisanship.
Sentence 39: It is a time for making use of the great talents of men like Dean Acheson.
Sentence 40: "Communism--not our own country-would be served if we lost Mr. Acheson.
Sentence 41: "
Q. Mr. President, you said to us quite recently that you would cut loose on us one of these days.
Sentence 42: In telling us this about Dean Acheson, is this it ?
Sentence 43: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: This is it.
Sentence 45: [Laughter] Q. Are there any further details now on the insides of recent policy-making, in which Mr. Acheson has figured strongly--with Congress?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 46: Well, Mr. Acheson and the leaders of the Congress, General Marshall and myself, and the Secretary of the Treasury, were present with these leaders, and the discussion was very amicable, and there was no objection that I could find to the foreign policy of the United States.
Sentence 47: That has been a continuing policy since 1939, and I have had four Secretaries of State, and the policy has not changed since I have been President of the United States.
Sentence 48: Nobody has been quarreling with that policy.
Sentence 49: These are personalities.
Sentence 50: The personalities in this last campaign were vicious.
Sentence 51: There were no issues discussed.
Sentence 52: People were slandered, and that is what has caused this situation.
Sentence 53: And I am very sorry for it, because it is not the right way for a two-party system to work.
Sentence 54: [2.]
Sentence 55: Q. Mr. President, speaking of General Marshall, there was a story in print yesterday afternoon and this morning that Mr. Symington
1
will replace Secretary Marshall early next year.
Sentence 56: Is that true?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 57: That's the first I've heard of it.
Sentence 58: There is nothing to it.
Sentence 59: Mr. Symington has a very important job, which he is filling in a very satisfactory manner, and he is going to stay there.
Sentence 60: And General Marshall is going to continue to be Secretary of Defense.
Sentence 61: And Mr. Lovett
2
is going to continue to be his Under Secretary, or Assistant Secretary--whatever his proper name is.
Sentence 62: 1
W. Stuart Symington, Chairman of the National Security Resources Board.
Sentence 63: 2
Robert A. Lovett, Deputy Secretary of Defense.
Sentence 64: [3.]
Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, in line with what you have been telling us about foreign policy, a number of writers believe that there is a--as they put it--a wave of isolationism rising in the United States.
Sentence 66: Do you feel that condition to exist?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: I don't think there is any wave of isolationism, outside of the Chicago Tribune and those papers.
Sentence 68: [Laughter]
Sentence 69: [4.]
Sentence 70: Q. Mr. President, there has been a book attacking the FBI by Mr. Lowenthal.
Sentence 71: 3
Do you approve or endorse that book?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 72: I haven't read the book, and I have no reason to approve or disapprove of it.
Sentence 73: Mr. Lowenthal had a perfect right to write any kind of book he wants to.
Sentence 74: 3
Max Lowenthal, "The Federal Bureau of Investigation," New York: Sloane, 1950.
Sentence 75: Q. Mr. President, I would like to ask also, since J. Edgar Hoover is still on the job, does that indicate he still has your full approval?
Sentence 76: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 77: Mr. Hoover has always been well thought of by me.
Sentence 78: [5.]
Sentence 79: Q. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question contradictory to the one that was asked a few moments ago about isolationism.
Sentence 80: I understand that the White House is getting a great deal of mail from.
Sentence 81: all over the country, especially from the Southwest, that is anything but isolationist, it means fight?
Sentence 82: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 83: That is correct.
Sentence 84: That is the way the majority of the mail always runs when the United States gets into trouble.
Sentence 85: All the people are behind the Government, and they are now; don't let anybody fool you about that.
Sentence 86: [6.]
Sentence 87: Q. Mr. President, this question is on behalf of the religious news services.
Sentence 88: A number of religious leaders, particularly in the South, have urged you to call a national day of prayer.
Sentence 89: Does the letter recently made public by Representative Hebert close the door on this suggestion, or is it still under consideration?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 90: No, it doesn't close the door.
Sentence 91: It never has been closed.
Sentence 92: And I think if you read my Thanksgiving proclamation, you will find that I asked for it then.
Sentence 93: 4
Sentence 94: And I am preparing a Christmas proclamation which I think will satisfy you, and the religious leaders, too.
Sentence 95: 4
On December 5, 1950, Representative F. Edward Hebert of Louisiana sent a letter to the President suggesting that he "call upon the churches of America, Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish, to set aside a Sunday between now and Christmas, to appeal to Almighty God for guidance and wisdom in what I believe to be the Gethsemane of our existence."
Sentence 96: The letter is printed in the Congressional Record along with the President's reply (vol. 96, p. A7834).
Sentence 97: Proclamation 2909 "Thanksgiving Day, 1950," signed by the President on October 19, requested all citizens to give thanks to God and to pray for peace (3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., p. 95).
Sentence 98: [7.]
Sentence 99: Q. Mr. President, what do you think of the General Motors counterfreeze on the sale of cars, after the Government's freeze of prices?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: The law will be enforced.
Sentence 101: [8.]
Sentence 102: Q. Mr. President, there is a report of the Allies approving a German air force to begin to defend Western Europe.
Sentence 103: Is that a part of our program--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: I can't answer the question for I haven't received the telegrams as yet which tell about the agreement, and I can't comment on it until I get all the facts and information, which I will get tomorrow from Dean Acheson when he comes back.
Sentence 105: [9.]
Sentence 106: Q. Mr. President, can you elaborate on "the law will be enforced"?
Sentence 107: Does that mean that the price will have to go back to December--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: The price will go back where the Economic Administrator says it shall go.
Sentence 109: Q. Mr. President, does that mean that you think the Government then, sir, could force any motor company to unfreeze its cars and sell them at that price?
Sentence 110: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: That is a matter that--we will cross that bridge when we get to it.
Sentence 112: [10.]
Sentence 113: Q. Mr. President, do I understand that you as of today have designated General Eisenhower as commander in chief?

Sentence 116: 5

THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 124: I can't do that.
Sentence 125: If I knew I wouldn't tell you.
Sentence 126: Q. Or how soon, sir?

Sentence 127: Just as soon as it is possible to get ready.
Sentence 128: That is the reason for this emergency I have just declared.
Sentence 129: Q. Mr. President, how soon does General Eisenhower expect to go, do you know?
Sentence 130: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: I talked to him last night on the telephone, and he is coming in to see me, and then he is going to Europe as promptly as possible.
Sentence 132: [11.]
Sentence 133: Q. Are you going home for Christmas, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 134: Well, I don't know.
Sentence 135: I had hoped to go on Friday, but whether I will be able to make it or not I can't tell you exactly; but then you fellows might keep your grips packed--you might need them.

THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 144: They requested me to appoint a commander in chief of Allied forces in Europe, just as they requested me to appoint a commander in chief of Allied forces in Asia; and that is what I have done.
Sentence 145: Q.
Sentence 146: I was thinking, Mr. President, that General MacArthur is working under the United Nations?
Sentence 147: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 149: Q. Mr. President, can you say how soon American divisions will be moving--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: No, I can't--no, I can't.
Sentence 151: As I say, if I could I wouldn't tell you.
Sentence 152: You fellows ought to have some ideas of security the same as I have.
