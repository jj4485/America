Sentence 67: [Laughter]
Q. Lot of other papers, too, Mr. President.
Sentence 68: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 71: [10.]
Sentence 72: Q. Mr. President, in your Budget Message you indicated that you were opposed to raising the subsistence payments to veterans at the present time, those in school--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 73: Only in special--I don't think that was in the Budget Message.
Sentence 74: You had better read it again.

Sentence 81: But I can't act on it until it gets before me.
Sentence 82: [12.]
Sentence 83: Q. I want to ask you about a paragraph in the air policy
Sentence 84: report.1 I don't know whether you paid any attention to it or not, but it states flatly there that we ought to have wartime security on aeronautical developments.
Sentence 85: I wonder if you have made up your mind about the possibility of reviving that?
Sentence 86: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: That is under consideration, but I have not made up my mind on the subject.
Sentence 88: 1 See Item 7.
Sentence 89: Q.
Sentence 90: What is under consideration?
Sentence 91: As to the broader question of censorship?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: No, no.
Sentence 93: What that report means is that we ought to keep our manufacturing plants in the condition so that it would be available for an emergency, and that doesn't necessarily mean that we have to keep it on a wartime basis.
Sentence 94: Q.
Sentence 95: That wasn't the thought, though, as I understood it.
Sentence 96: The question was whether we should give everybody our developments as fast as they come along, and this policy report recommended that we do not do that, that we have wartime security, so called.
Sentence 97: Does that mean revival--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 98: I didn't understand it that way at all.
Sentence 99: Q.
Sentence 100: That is one of the ways I understood it, though.
Sentence 101: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 102: There are some things-for instance atomic energy and the making of our atomic weapons--that we are not giving publicity to, and there are some things in relation to planes that we do not expect to make public.
Sentence 103: But things that have an effect on transportation and the use of planes for commercial use, will be available.
Sentence 104: [13.]
Sentence 105: Q. Mr. President, would you give your present views on legislation giving States the right to submerged tidelands?
Sentence 106: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: I can't do that until I see what legislation the Congress is going to send to me.
Sentence 108: Then I will comment on it.
Sentence 109: [14.]
Sentence 110: Q. Mr. President, to get back to this question of security, does that mean-you say we are not putting out certain things about the making of atomic weapons and certain planes--does that mean that-will there be any new form of censorship to prevent publication of--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: I don't think it's necessary.
Sentence 112: I don't think there's any man here who would want to give away a secret that might be expensive to us in the long run.
Sentence 113: Q. No, but there is considerable philosophy along the line that we should have some sort of clearance, at least that is what Mr. Forrestal has been talking--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 114: Well, I haven't discussed it with him.
Sentence 115: Q.
Sentence 116: A man sits there, who virtually tells you that that is all right to use or isn't all right to use, as was done by Byron Price during the war.
Sentence 117: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 118: I haven't come to any such conclusion.
Sentence 119: At the same time, I hadn't considered the matter along that line at all.
Sentence 120: [15.]
Sentence 121: Q. Mr. President, could you tell us something about the background of the reopening of our air base in Tripoli?

Sentence 124: [16.]
Sentence 125: Q. Mr. President, will you have a special message on the St. Lawrence in the next week or two?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 126: I don't know that it will be a special message, but probably will be a letter 1 urging passage of the St. Lawrence Seaway project.
Sentence 127: I think the Senate committee has acted on it.
Sentence 128: I am not sure.
Sentence 129: 1 See Item 12.
Sentence 130: Q.
Sentence 131: It was reported out.
Sentence 132: [17.]
Sentence 133: Q. Mr. President, do you think, in view of the Palestine situation, that American troops might be sent to Palestine?
Sentence 134: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 135: I do not.
Sentence 136: I have no further comment to make on that.
Sentence 137: Probably in the long run we will have an international police force with the United Nations plan, to which all of us are working.
Sentence 138: [18.]
Sentence 139: Q. Mr. President, I wonder if you would clarify one thing that is in the economic report, where you say you would have budget credit controls that would bring down the cost of living and keep rent costs from going up?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 140: I don't remember that point at the present time.
Sentence 141: I will look it up for you, though.
Sentence 142: [19.]
Sentence 143: Q. Mr. President, could we go back to the question of Palestine?
Sentence 144: Do you mean in the long run there would be an international police force in Palestine?

Sentence 148: [20.]

Sentence 153: [Laughter]
Sentence 154: [21.]
Sentence 155: Q. Mr. President, you indicated that newspapers didn't want to give information about that balcony, which of course is more or less personal with you, but do you care to say anything about it for--
THE PRESIDENT, I would rather not.
Sentence 156: Q.__along the--some sort of statement would be good, it's always interesting--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 157: I can tell you some other thing.
Sentence 158: There was the same opposition to putting bathtubs in the White House, and a cooking stove, and gaslight.
Sentence 159: [Laughter]
Q. But Mr. President, they didn't change the structural appearance.
Sentence 160: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 161: Oh yes, but they did, in some instances.
Sentence 162: Entirely changed the interior of the White House when they put in bathrooms.
Sentence 163: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 164: The first bathroom was thrown out by Andrew Jackson.
Sentence 165: He said that washing made you too soft.
Sentence 166: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 168: Q. Was that it?

Sentence 180: Bathtub, gaslight, and what?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 181: Cooking stove.
Sentence 182: The cooks refused to use the cooking stove.
Sentence 183: They kept using the old fireplace.
Sentence 184: Q. Mr. President, the Republican comment is that you are only a temporary tenant, therefore you are not--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 185: No President has been anything else but a temporary tenant.
Sentence 186: That will continue, I hope, as long as our Republic lasts.
Sentence 187: [22.]
Sentence 188: Q. Mr. President, in connection with the visit of Mr. Michael Pearson,
