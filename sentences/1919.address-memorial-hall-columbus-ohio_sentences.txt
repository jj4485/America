Sentence 1: 1919 Address Memorial Hall Columbus Ohio

Mr. Chairman, Gov. Campbell, my fellow citizens, it is with very profound pleasure that I find myself face to face with you.
Sentence 2: I have for a long time chafed at the confinement of Washington.
Sentence 3: I have for a long time wished to fulfill the purpose with which my heart was full when I returned to our beloved country, namely, to go out and report to my fellow countrymen concerning those affairs of the world which now need to be settled.
Sentence 4: The only people I owe any report to are you and the other citizens of the United States.
Sentence 5: And it has become increasingly necessary, apparently, that I should report to you.
Sentence 6: After all the various angles at which you have heard the treaty held up, perhaps you would like to know what is in the treaty.
Sentence 7: I find it very difficult in reading some of the speeches that I have read to form any conception of that great document.
Sentence 8: It is a document unique in the history of the world for many reasons, and I think I can not do you a better service, or the peace of the world a better service, than by pointing out to you just what this treaty contains and what it seeks to do.
Sentence 9: In the first place, my fellow countrymen, it seeks to punish one of the greatest wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization; and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment.
Sentence 10: She attempted an intolerable thing, and she must be made to pay for the attempt.
Sentence 11: The terms of the treaty are severe, but they are not unjust.
Sentence 12: I can testify that the men associated with me at the peace conference in Paris had it in their hearts to do justice and not wrong.
Sentence 13: But they knew, perhaps, with a more vivid sense of what had happened than we could possibly know on this side of the water, the many solemn covenants which Germany had disregarded, the long preparation she had made to overwhelm her neighbors, and the utter disregard which she had shown for human rights, for the rights of women, of children, of those who were helpless.
Sentence 14: They had seen their lands devastated by an enemy that devoted himself not only to the effort at victory, but to the effort at terror—seeking to terrify the people whom he fought.
Sentence 15: And I wish to testify that they exercised restraint in the terms of this treaty.
Sentence 16: They did not wish to overwhelm any great nation.
Sentence 17: They acknowledged that Germany was a great nation, and they had no purpose of overwhelming the German people, but they did think that it ought to be burned into the consciousness of men forever that no people ought to permit its government to do what the German Government did.
Sentence 18: In the last analysis, my fellow countrymen, as we in America would be the first to claim, a people are responsible for the acts of their government.
Sentence 19: If their government purposes things that are wrong, they ought to take measures to see to it that that purpose is not executed.
Sentence 20: Germany was self-governed; her rulers had not concealed the purposes that they had in mind, but they had deceived their people as.
Sentence 21: to the character of the methods they were going to use, and I believe from what I can learn that there is an awakened consciousness in Germany itself of the deep iniquity of the thing that was attempted.
Sentence 22: When the Austrian delegates came before the peace conference, they in so many words spoke of the origination of the war as a crime and admitted in our presence that it was a thing intolerable to contemplate.
Sentence 23: They knew in their hearts that it had done them the deepest conceivable wrong, that it had put their people and the people of Germany at the judgment seat of mankind, and throughout this treaty every term that was applied to Germany was meant, not to humiliate Germany, but to rectify the wrong that she had done.
Sentence 24: Look even into the severe terms of reparation—for there was no indemnity.
Sentence 25: No indemnity of any sort was claimed, merely reparation, merely paying for the destruction done, merely making good the losses so far as such losses could be made good which she had unjustly inflicted, not upon the governments, for the reparation is not to go to the governments, but upon the people whose rights she had trodden upon with absolute absence of everything that even resembled pity.
Sentence 26: There was no indemnity in this treaty, but there is reparation, and even in the terms of reparation a method is devised by which the reparation shall be adjusted to Germany's ability to pay it.
Sentence 27: I am astonished at some of the statements I hear made about this treaty.
Sentence 28: The truth is that they are made by persons who have not read the treaty or who, if they have read it, have not comprehended its meaning.
Sentence 29: There is a method of adjustment in that treaty by which the reparation shall not be pressed beyond the point which Germany can pay, but which will be pressed to the utmost point that Germany can pay—which is just, which is righteous.
Sentence 30: It would have been intolerable if there had been anything else.
Sentence 31: For, my fellow citizens, this treaty is not meant merely to end this single war.
Sentence 32: It is meant as a notice to every government which in the future will attempt this thing that mankind will unite to inflict the same punishment.
Sentence 33: There is no national triumph sought to be recorded in this treaty.
Sentence 34: There is no glory sought for any particular nation.
Sentence 35: The thought of the statesmen collected around that table was of their people, of the sufferings that they had gone through, of the losses they had incurred—that great throbbing heart which was so depressed, so forlorn, so sad in every memory that it had had of the five tragical years that have gone.
Sentence 36: Let us never forget those years, my fellow countrymen.
Sentence 37: Let us never forget the purpose—the high purpose, the disinterested purpose—with which America lent its strength not for its own glory but for the defense of mankind.
Sentence 38: As I said, this treaty was not intended merely to end this war.
Sentence 39: It was intended to prevent any similar war.
Sentence 40: I wonder if some of the opponents of the league of nations have forgotten the promises we made our people before we went to that peace table.
Sentence 41: We had taken by processes of law the flower of our youth from every household, and we told those mothers and fathers and sisters and wives and sweethearts that we were taking those men to fight a war which would end business of that sort; and if we do not end it, if we do not do the best that human concert of action can do to end it, we are of all men the most unfaithful, the most unfaithful to the loving hearts who suffered in this war, the most unfaithful to those households bowed in grief and yet lifted with the feeling that the lad laid down his life for a great thing and, among other things, in order that other lads might never have to do the same thing.
Sentence 42: That is what the league of nations is for, to end this war justly, and then not merely to serve notice on governments which would contemplate the same things that Germany contemplated that they will do it at their peril, but also concerning the combination of power which will prove to them that they will do it at their peril.
Sentence 43: It is idle to say the world will combine against you, because it may not, but it is persuasive to say the world is combined against you, and will remain combined against the things that Germany attempted.
Sentence 44: The league of nations is the only thing that can prevent the recurrence of this dreadful catastrophe and redeem our promises.
Sentence 45: The character of the league is based upon the experience of this very war.
Sentence 46: I did not meet a single public man who did not admit these things, that Germany would not have gone into this war if she had thought Great Britain was going into it, and that she most certainly would never have gone into this war if she dreamed America was going into it.
Sentence 47: And they all admitted that a notice beforehand that the greatest powers of the world would combine to prevent this sort of thing would prevent it absolutely.
Sentence 48: When gentlemen tell you, therefore, that the league of nations is intended for some other purpose than this, merely reply this to them: If we do not do this thing, we have neglected the central covenant that we made to our people, and there will then be no statesmen of any country who can thereafter promise his people alleviation from the perils of war.
Sentence 49: The passions of this world are not dead.
Sentence 50: The rivalries of this world have not cooled.
Sentence 51: They have been rendered hotter than ever.
Sentence 52: The harness that is to unite nations is more necessary now than it ever was before, and unless there is this assurance of combined action before wrong is attempted, wrong will be attempted just so soon as the most ambitious nations can recover from the financial stress of this war.
Sentence 53: Now, look what else is in the treaty.
Sentence 54: This treaty is unique in the history of mankind, because the center of it is the redemption of weak nations.
Sentence 55: There never was a congress of nations before that considered the rights of those who could not enforce their rights.
Sentence 56: There never was a congress of nations before that did not seek to effect some balance of power brought about by means of serving the strength and interest of the strongest powers concerned; whereas this treaty builds up nations that never could have won their freedom in any other way; builds them up by gift, by largess, not by obligations; builds them up because of the conviction of the men who wrote the treaty that the rights of people transcend the rights of governments, because of the conviction of the men who wrote that treaty that the fertile source of war is wrong.
Sentence 57: The Austro-Hungarian Empire, for example, was held together by military force and consisted of peoples who did not want to live together, who did not have the spirit of nationality as toward each other, who were constantly chafing at the bands that held them.
Sentence 58: Hungary, though a willing partner of Austria, was willing to be a partner because she could share Austria's strength to accomplish her own ambitions, and her own ambitions were to hold under her the Jugo-Slavic peoples that lay to the south of her; Bohemia, an unhappy partner, a partner by duress, beating in all her veins the strongest national impulse that was to be found anywhere in Europe; and north of that, pitiful Poland, a great nation divided up among the great powers of Europe, torn asunder, kinship disregarded, natural ties treated with contempt, and an obligatory division among sovereigns imposed upon her—a part of her given to Russia, a part of her given to Austria, a part of her given to Germany—great bodies of Polish people never permitted to have the normal intercourse with their kinsmen for fear that that fine instinct of the heart should assert itself which binds families together.
Sentence 59: Poland could never have won her independence.
Sentence 60: Bohemia never could have broken away from the Austro-Hungarian combination.
Sentence 61: The Slavic peoples to the south, running down into the great Balkan Peninsula, had again and again tried to assert their nationality and independence, and had as often been crushed, not by the immediate power they were fighting, but by the combined power of Europe.
Sentence 62: The old alliances, the old balances of power, were meant to see to it that no little nation asserted its right to the disturbance of the peace of Europe, and every time an assertion of rights was attempted they were suppressed by combined influence and force.
Sentence 63: This treaty tears away all that: says these people have a right to live their own lives under the governments which they themselves choose to set up.
Sentence 64: That is the American principle, and I was glad to fight for it.
Sentence 65: When strategic claims were urged, it was matter of common counsel that such considerations were not in our thought.
Sentence 66: We were not now arranging for future wars.
Sentence 67: We were giving people what belonged to them.
Sentence 68: My fellow citizens, I do not think there is any man alive who has a more tender sympathy for the great people of Italy than I have, and a very stern duty was presented to us when we had to consider some of the claims of Italy on the Adriatic, because strategically, from the point of view of future wars, Italy needed a military foothold on the other side of the Adriatic, but her people did not live there except in little spots.
Sentence 69: It was a Slavic people, and I had to say to my Italian friends, "Every where else in this treaty we have given territory to the people who lived on it, and I do not think that it is for the advantage of Italy, and I am sure it is not for the advantage of the world, to give Italy territory where other people live."
Sentence 70: I felt the force of the argument for what they wanted, and it was the old argument that had always prevailed, namely, that they needed it from a military point of view, and I have no doubt that if there is no league of nations, they will need it from a military point of view; but if there is a league of nations, they will not need it from a military point of view.
Sentence 71: If there is no league of nations, the military point of view will prevail in every instance, and peace will be brought into contempt, but if there is a league of nations, Italy need not fear the fact that the shores on the other side of the Adriatic tower above the lower and sandy shores on her side the sea, because there will be no threatening guns there, and the nations of the world will have concerted, not merely to see that the Slavic peoples have their rights, but that the Italian people have their rights as well.
Sentence 72: I had rather have everybody on my side than be armed to the teeth.
Sentence 73: Every settlement that is right, every settlement that is based on the principles I have alluded to, is a safe settlement, because the sympathy of mankind will be behind it.
Sentence 74: Some gentlemen have feared with regard to the league of nations that we will be obliged to do things we do not want to do.
Sentence 75: If the treaty were wrong, that might be so, but if the treaty is right, we will wish to preserve right.
Sentence 76: I think I know the heart of this great people whom I, for the time being have the high honor to represent better than some other men that I hear talk.
Sentence 77: I have been bred, and am proud to have been bred, in the old revolutionary school which set this Government up, when it was set up as the friend of mankind, and I know if they do not that America has never lost that vision or that purpose.
Sentence 78: But I have not the slightest fear that arms will be necessary if the purpose is there.
Sentence 79: If I know that my adversary is armed and I am not, I do not press the controversy, and if any nation entertains selfish purposes set against the principles established in this treaty and is told by the rest of the world that it must withdraw its claims, it will not press them.
Sentence 80: The heart of this treaty then, my fellow citizens, is not even that it punishes Germany.
Sentence 81: That is a temporary thing.
Sentence 82: It is that it rectifies the age-long wrongs which characterized the history of Europe.
Sentence 83: There were some of us who wished that the scope of the treaty would reach some other age-long wrongs.
Sentence 84: It was a big job, and I do not say that we wished that it were bigger, but there were other wrongs elsewhere than in Europe and of the same kind which no doubt ought to be righted, and some day will be righted, but which we could not draw into the treaty because we could deal only with the countries whom the war had engulfed and affected.
Sentence 85: But so far as the scope of our authority went, we rectified the wrongs which have been the fertile source of war in Europe.
Sentence 86: Have you ever reflected, my fellow countrymen, on the real source of revolution?
Sentence 87: Men do not start revolutions in a sudden passion.
Sentence 88: Do you remember what Thomas Carlisle said about the French Revolution?
Sentence 89: He was speaking of the so-called Hundred Days Terror which reigned not only in Paris, but throughout France, in the days of the French Revolution, and he reminded his readers that back of that hundred days lay several hundred years of agony and of wrong.
Sentence 90: The French people had been deeply and consistently wronged by their Government, robbed, their human rights disregarded.
Sentence 91: and the slow agony of those hundreds of years had after awhile gathered into a hot anger that could not be suppressed.
Sentence 92: Revolutions do not spring up overnight.
Sentence 93: Revolutions come from the long suppression of the human spirit.
Sentence 94: Revolutions come because men know that they have rights and that they are disregarded; and when we think of the future of the world in connection with this treaty we must remember that one of the chief efforts of those who made this treaty was to remove that anger from the heart of great peoples, great peoples who had always been suppressed, who had always been used, and who had always been the tools in the hands of governments, generally alien governments, not their own.
Sentence 95: The makers of the treaty knew that if these wrongs were not removed, there could be no peace in the world, because, after all, my fellow citizens, war comes from the seed of wrong and not from the seed of right.
Sentence 96: This treaty is an attempt to right the history of Europe, and, in my humble judgment, it is a measurable success.
Sentence 97: I say "measurable," my fellow citizens, because you will realize the difficulty of this:
Here are two neighboring peoples.
Sentence 98: The one people have not stopped at a sharp line, and the settlements of the other people or their migrations have not begun at a sharp line.
Sentence 99: They have intermingled.
Sentence 100: There are regions where you can not draw a national line and say there are Slavs on this side
Sentence 101: [illustrating] and Italians on that [illustrating].
Sentence 102: It can not be done.
Sentence 103: You have to approximate the line.
Sentence 104: You have to come as near to it as you can, and then trust to the processes of history to redistribute, it may be, the people that are oh the wrong side of the line.
Sentence 105: There are many such lines drawn in this treaty and to be drawn in the Austrian treaty, where there are perhaps more lines of that sort than in the German treaty.
Sentence 106: When we came to draw the line between the Polish people and the German people—not the line between Germany and Poland; there was no Poland, strictly speaking, but the line between the German and the Polish people—we were confronted by such problems as the disposition of districts like the eastern part of Silesia, which is called Upper Silesia because it is mountainous and the other part is not.
Sentence 107: Upper Silesia is chiefly Polish, and when we came to draw the line of what should be Poland it was necessary to include Upper Silesia if we were really going to play fair and make Poland up of the Polish peoples wherever we found them in sufficiently close neighborhood to one another, but it was not perfectly clear that Upper Silesia wanted to be part of Poland.
Sentence 108: At any rate, there were Germans in Upper Silesia who said that it did not, and therefore we did there what we did in many other places.
Sentence 109: We said, "Very well, then, we will let the people that live there decide.
Sentence 110: We will have a referendum.
Sentence 111: Within a certain length of time after the war, under the supervision of an international commission which will have a sufficient armed force behind it to preserve order and see that nobody interferes with the elections, we will have an absolutely free vote and Upper Silesia shall go either to Germany or to Poland, as the people in Upper Silesia prefer."
Sentence 112: That illustrates many other cases where we provided for a referendum, or a plebiscite, as they chose to call it.
Sentence 113: We are going to leave it to the people themselves, as we should have done, what government they shall live under.
Sentence 114: It is none of my prerogative to allot peoples to this government or the other.
Sentence 115: It is nobody's right to do that allotting except the people themselves, and I want to testify that this treaty is shot through with the American principle of the choice of the governed.
Sentence 116: Of course, at times it went further than we could make a practical policy of, because various peoples were keen upon getting back portions of their population which were separated from them by many miles of territory, and we could not spot the map over with little pieces of separated States.
Sentence 117: I even reminded my Italian colleagues that if they were going to claim every place where there was a large Italian population, we would have to cede New York to them, because there are more Italians in New York than in any Italian city.
Sentence 118: But I hope, I believe, that the Italians in New York City are as glad to stay there as we are to have them.
Sentence 119: But I would not have you suppose that I am intimating that my Italian colleagues entered any claim for New York City.
Sentence 120: We of all peoples in the world, my fellow citizens, ought to be able to understand the questions of this treaty without anybody explaining them to us, for we are made up out of all the peoples of the world.
Sentence 121: I dare say that in this audience there are representatives of practically all the people dealt with in this treaty.
Sentence 122: You do not have to have me explain national aspirations to you.
Sentence 123: You have been brought up on them.
Sentence 124: You have learned of them since you were children, and it is those national aspirations which we sought to release and give an outlet to in this great treaty.
Sentence 125: But we did much more than that.
Sentence 126: This treaty contains among other things a Magna Charta of labor—a thing unheard of until this interesting year of grace.
Sentence 127: There is a whole section of the treaty devoted to arrangements by which the interests of those who labor with their hands all over the world, whether they be men or women or children, are sought to be safeguarded; and next month there is to meet the first assembly under this section of the league.
Sentence 128: Let me tell you, it will meet whether the treaty is ratified by that time or not.
Sentence 129: There is to meet an assembly which represents the interests of laboring men throughout the world.
Sentence 130: Not their political interests; there is nothing political about it.
Sentence 131: It is the interests of men concerning the conditions of their labor; concerning the character of labor which women shall engage in, the character of labor which children shall be permitted to engage in; the hours of labor; and, incidentally, of course, the remuneration of labor; that labor shall be remunerated in proportion, of course, to the maintenance of the standard of living, which is proper, for the man who is expected to give his whole brain and intelligence and energy to a particular task.
Sentence 132: I hear very little said about the Magna Charta of labor which is embodied in this treaty.
Sentence 133: It forecasts the day, which ought to have come long ago, when statesmen will realize that no nation is fortunate which is not happy and that no nation can be happy whose people are not contented; contented in their lives and fortunate in the circumstances of their lives.
Sentence 134: If I were to state what seems to me the central idea of this treaty, it would be this: It is almost a discovery in international conventions that nations do not consist of their governments but consist of their people.
Sentence 135: That is a rudimentary idea.
Sentence 136: It seems to us in America to go without saying, but, my fellow citizens, it was never the leading idea in any other international congress that I ever heard of; that is to say, any international congress made up of the representatives of governments.
Sentence 137: They were always thinking of national policy, of national advantage, of the rivalries of trade, of the advantages of territorial conquest.
Sentence 138: There is nothing of that in this treaty.
Sentence 139: You will notice that even the territories which are taken away from Germany, like her colonies, are not given to anybody.
Sentence 140: There is not a single act of annexation in this treaty.
Sentence 141: Territories inhabited by people not yet to govern themselves, either because of economical or other circumstances, are put under the care of powers, who are to act as trustees—trustees responsible in the form of the world at the bar of the league of nations, and the terms upon which they are to exercise their trusteeship are outlined.
Sentence 142: They are not to use those people by way of draft to fight their wars for them.
Sentence 143: They are not to permit any form of slavery among them, or of enforced labor.
Sentence 144: They are to see to it that there are humane conditions of labor with regard not only to the women and children but to the men also.
Sentence 145: They are to establish no fortifications.
Sentence 146: They are to regulate the liquor and the opium traffic.
Sentence 147: They are to see to it, in other words, that the lives of the people whose care they assume—not sovereignty over whom they assume—are kept clean and safe and wholesome.
Sentence 148: There again the principle of the treaty comes out, that the object of the arrangement is the welfare of the people who live there, and not the advantage of the trustee.
Sentence 149: It goes beyond that.
Sentence 150: It seeks to gather under the common supervision of the league of nations the various instrumentalities by which the world has been trying to check the evils that were in some places debasing men, like the opium traffic, like the traffic—for it was a traffic—in women and children, like the traffic in other dangerous drugs, like the traffic in arms among uncivilized people who could use arms only for their own detriment.
Sentence 151: It provides for sanitation, for the work of the Red Cross.
Sentence 152: Why, those clauses, my fellow citizens, draw the hearts of the world into league, draw the noble impulses of the world together and make a team of them.
Sentence 153: I used to be told that this was an age in which mind was monarch, and my comment was that if that was true, the mind was one of those modern monarchs that reigns and does not govern; that, as a matter of fact, we were governed by a great representative assembly made up of the human passions, and that the best we could manage was that the high and fine passions should be in a majority so that they could control the baser passions, so that they could check the things that were wrong.
Sentence 154: This treaty seeks something like that.
Sentence 155: In drawing the humane endeavors of the world together it makes a league of the fine passions of the world, of its philanthropic passions, of its passion of pity, of its passion of human sympathy, of its passion of human friendliness and helpfulness, for there is such a passion.
Sentence 156: It is the passion which has lifted us along the slow road of civilization.
Sentence 157: It is the passion which has made ordered government possible.
Sentence 158: It is the passion which has made justice and established it in the world.
Sentence 159: That is the treaty.
Sentence 160: Did you ever hear of it before?
Sentence 161: Did you ever know before what was in this treaty?
Sentence 162: Did anybody before ever tell you what the treaty was intended to do?
Sentence 163: I beg, my fellow citizens, that you and the rest of those Americans with whom we are happy to be associated all over this broad land will read the treaty yourselves, or, if you will not take the time to do that—for it is a technical document—that you will accept the interpretation of those who made it and know what the intentions were in the making of it.
Sentence 164: I hear a great deal, my fellow citizens, about the selfishness and the selfish ambitions of other governments, and I would not be doing justice to the gifted men with whom I was associated on the other side of the water if I did not testify that the purposes that I have outlined were their purposes.
Sentence 165: We differed as to the method very often.
Sentence 166: We had discussions as to the details, but we never had any serious discussion as to the principle.
Sentence 167: While we all acknowledged that the principles might perhaps in detail have been better realized, we are all back of those principles.
Sentence 168: There is a concert of mind and of purpose and of policy in the world that was never in existence before.
Sentence 169: I am not saying that by way of credit to myself or to those colleagues to whom I have alluded, because what happened to us was that we got messages from our people.
Sentence 170: We were under instructions, whether they were written down or not, and we did not dare come home without fulfilling those instructions.
Sentence 171: If I could not have brought back the kind of treaty that I did bring back, I never would have come back, because I would have been an unfaithful servant, and you would have had the right to condemn me in any way that you chose to use.
Sentence 172: So that I testify that this is an American treaty not only, but it is a treaty that expresses the heart of the great peoples who were associated together in the war against Germany.
Sentence 173: I said at the opening of this informal address, my fellow citizens that I had come to make a report to you.
Sentence 174: I want to add to that a little bit.
Sentence 175: I have not come to debate the treaty.
Sentence 176: It speaks for itself, if you will let it.
Sentence 177: The arguments directed against it are directed against it with a radical misunderstanding of the instrument itself.
Sentence 178: Therefore, I am not going anywhere to debate the treaty.
Sentence 179: I am going to expound it, and I am going, as I do here, now, to-day, to urge you in every vocal method that you can use to assert the spirit of the American people in support of it.
Sentence 180: Do not let men pull it down.
Sentence 181: Do not let them misrepresent it.
Sentence 182: Do not let them lead this Nation away from the high purposes with which this war was inaugurated and fought.
Sentence 183: As I came through that line of youngsters in khaki a few minutes ago I felt that I could salute them because I had done the job in the way I promised them I would do it, and when this treaty is accepted, men in khaki will not have to cross the seas again.
Sentence 184: That is the reason I believe in it.
Sentence 185: I say "when it is accepted," for it will be accepted.
Sentence 186: I have never entertained a moment's doubt of that, and the only thing I have been impatient of has been the delay.
Sentence 187: It is not dangerous delay, except for the temper of the peoples scattered throughout the world who are waiting.
Sentence 188: Do you realize, my fellow citizens, that the whole world is waiting on America?
Sentence 189: The only country in the world that is trusted at this moment is the United States, and the peoples of the world are waiting to see whether their trust is justified or not.
Sentence 190: That has been the ground of my impatience.
Sentence 191: I knew their trust was justified, but I begrudged the time that certain gentlemen wish to take in telling them so.
Sentence 192: We shall tell them so in a voice as authentic as any voice in history, and in the years to come men will be glad to remember that they had some part in the great struggle which brought this incomparable consummation of the hopes of mankind.
