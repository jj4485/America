Sentence 130: Q. Is that legislation necessary for such an appointment?

Sentence 134: Well, we'll see.

Sentence 138: I don't think there is a dear understanding by the public, or even in the Congress, on what is meant by civilian control of that board.
Sentence 139: I have tried to make that Perfectly clear in my letter of February 2d, I believe it was, on a--the idea is that the military, of course, has an important part to play and should be consulted, but it is a mistake to believe that only the military can guard the national security.
Sentence 140: The full responsibility for a balanced and forceful development of atomic energy looking toward the national economic good, national security, and a firm, clear position toward other nations and world peace, should rest with the civilian group directly responsible to the President.
Sentence 141: Now the President is the Commander in Chief of the Armed forces of the United States, and is charged with the security of the United States in the first place; and the civilian board under him would in no way hamper the military in their proper function.

Sentence 152: No, I can't.
Sentence 153: [17.]
Sentence 154: Q. Mr. President, I was wondering if you could put in an affirmative way, on this situation about not sharing this international picture fraught with danger--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 155: Well, would it help you to say I am not alarmed by it?
Sentence 156: Q. Yes, sir.
Sentence 157: Q. Well, are you optimistic that we will work out of this?
Sentence 158: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 159: I am sure we will work out of it.
Sentence 160: [18.]
Sentence 161: Q. Going back to that atomic situation for a moment, Mr. President, when you say that you are for a civilian board, that implies that you support the position of Senator McMahon?
Sentence 162: Is that correct?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 163: If you would read the letter sent down there February 2d, that sets out my position very clearly, and I will furnish you with a copy of it after the conference is over.

Sentence 176: He has never had any intention of resigning, and he is not going to resign, either on his own initiative or by request.
Sentence 177: Q. Mr. President, I am curious--I think we all are--as to why you voluntarily brought that up as the first thing in the press conference?
Sentence 178: Have you been hearing new rumors yourself?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 179: Oh, yes.
Sentence 180: All the gossip columns are full of it.
Sentence 181: Of course, I never believe the gossip columns, but then a lot of people read them.
Sentence 182: Q.
Sentence 183: How do you know what's in them?
Sentence 184: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 185: Somebody presents them to me, usually.
Sentence 186: Q. Did you say you never read them?
Sentence 187: Q.

Sentence 189: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 190: I didn't say I didn't read, I said I didn't believe them.

Sentence 193: That's all right.
Sentence 194: That was a good question--[more laughter]-- anyway.
Sentence 195: [21.]
Sentence 196: Q. Mr. President, the statement given out by Senator McFarland the other day, about your desire that he remain in the Senate, and the fact that Senator Mead saw you yesterday, makes me wonder have you a general policy of asking Senators-Democratic Senators--to remain in the Senate, if these other things do open up to them?
Sentence 197: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 198: Yes.
Sentence 199: And I think it's better for a Senator with experience to remain in the Senate.
Sentence 200: I was in the Senate 10 years myself.
Sentence 201: I know that length of service and experience is of--is invaluable to a State, and to its Senators.
Sentence 202: Q. Did you make that argument to Senator Mead yesterday, or do you mind telling us?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 203: Well, we didn't discuss that at all.
Sentence 204: Q.
Sentence 205: You didn't?
Sentence 206: I thought you discussed New York politics yesterday?
Sentence 207: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 208: No.
Sentence 209: No New York politics were mentioned.
Sentence 210: Q.
Sentence 211: Do you think Senator Mead will run for Governor of New York?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 212: I don't know.
Sentence 213: Q.
Sentence 214: Do you think that Governor Lehman will run for Senator, in the event that Senator Mead--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 215: Neither subject has been discussed with me.

Sentence 220: Q.
Sentence 221: Oh, I see.
Sentence 222: Drew Pearson had one today, that Senator Wagner is going to resign.
Sentence 223: Do you know anything about that?

Sentence 259: And there was such strong pressure-you know the very first thing the Congress acted on in the program was to set the clock back.
Sentence 260: So they may want to keep it set back.
