Sentence 197: Q.
Sentence 198: But you do draw a distinction between spending an appropriation--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 199: I certainly do.
Sentence 200: That is the discretionary power of the President.
Sentence 201: If he doesn't feel like the money should be spent, I don't think he can be forced to spend it.
Sentence 202: How would you go about making him spend it, Miss May?
Sentence 203: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 204: Oh, I believe in Congress being paramount.
Sentence 205: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 206: Of course you do.
Sentence 207: I don't.
Sentence 208: [More laughter] I think they are equal--I think they are equal.
Sentence 209: The Congress's job is to make the laws, and the President's job is to carry them out and enforce them, and he does just that.
