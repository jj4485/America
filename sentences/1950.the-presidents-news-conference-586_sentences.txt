Sentence 1: 1950 The Presidents News Conference 586

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I have a statement I want to read to you.
Sentence 4: It will be handed to you in mimeographed form after the press conference.
Sentence 5: [Reading] "The United States Government has always stood for good faith in international relations.
Sentence 6: Traditional United States policy toward China, as exemplified in the open-door policy, called for international respect for the territorial integrity of China.
Sentence 7: This principle was recently reaffirmed in the United Nations General Assembly Resolution of December 8, 1949, which, in part, calls on all states, and I quote:
"'To refrain from (a) seeking to acquire spheres of influence or to create foreign controlled regimes within the territory of China; (b) seeking to obtain special rights or privileges within the territory of China.'
Sentence 8: "
That is the end of the quotation from the United Nations Resolution.
Sentence 9: [Continuing reading] "A specific application of the foregoing principles is seen in the present situation with respect to Formosa.
Sentence 10: In the Joint Declaration at Cairo on December 1, 1943, the President of the United States, the British Prime Minister, and the President of China stated that it was their purpose that territories Japan had stolen from China, such as Formosa, should be restored to the Republic of China.
Sentence 11: The United States was a signatory to the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945, which declared that the terms of the Cairo Declaration should be carried out.
Sentence 12: The provisions of this declaration were accepted by Japan at the time of its surrender.
Sentence 13: In keeping with these declarations, Formosa was surrendered to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and for the past 4 years the United States and other Allied Powers have accepted the exercise of Chinese authority over the island.
Sentence 14: "The United States has no predatory designs on Formosa, or on any other Chinese territory.
Sentence 15: The United States has no desire to obtain special rights or privileges, or to establish military bases on Formosa at this time.
Sentence 16: Nor does it have any intention of utilizing its Armed Forces to interfere in the present situation.
Sentence 17: The United States Government will not pursue a course which will lead to involvement in the civil conflict in China.
Sentence 18: "Similarly, the United States Government will not provide military aid or advice to Chinese forces on Formosa.
Sentence 19: In the view of the United States Government, the resources on Formosa are adequate to enable them to obtain the items which they might consider necessary for the defense of the island.
Sentence 20: The United States Government proposes to continue under existing legislative authority the present ECA program of economic assistance.
Sentence 21: "
At 2:30 this afternoon Dean Acheson will hold a press conference and further elaborate on the details with reference to this statement which I have just issued on the policy of the United States Government toward China and Formosa.
Sentence 22: 1
1 For the remarks of the Secretary of State at his press conference on January 5, see the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 22, p. 79).
Sentence 23: I do not want to answer any questions on the subject now, so save your questions for this afternoon.
Sentence 24: Are there any other questions?
Sentence 25: [Laughter]
Sentence 26: [2.]
Sentence 27: Q. Mr. President, I have a couple of atomic energy questions.
Sentence 28: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 29: Shoot.
Sentence 30: Q.
Sentence 31: Since you were the source of information on the first Russian atomic bomb explosion, can you comment on a London report that said Russia is going to explode another bomb next Saturday ?
Sentence 32: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: I had no advance information on the explosion of the other Russian bomb.
Sentence 34: Naturally, I have no advance information on this one.
Sentence 35: 2
2 For the statement by the President announcing the first atomic explosion in the Soviet Union, see 1949 volume, this series, Item 216.
Sentence 36: [3.]
Sentence 37: Q. Mr. President, were you personally sufficiently acquainted with Sir Willmott Lewis
3
that you would care to comment on his passing?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: I was just casually acquainted with him, but I knew him by reputation, and of course I was sincerely sorry to hear of his passing.
Sentence 39: I didn't know about it until I saw it in the paper, I think this morning.
Sentence 40: 3 Sir Willmott H. Lewis, Washington correspondent emeritus of the London Times.
Sentence 41: [4.]
Sentence 42: Q. Mr. President, the St. Louis Citizens Fuel Committee and the St. Louis Retail Coal Association both wired you, either last night or today, saying that while temperatures were dropping out there their fuel supply was running low, and urged that for public health and safety you secure full operation of the coal mines without delay.
Sentence 43: Have you seen those telegrams ?
Sentence 44: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 45: No, I haven't seen them.
Sentence 46: Q.
Sentence 47: Any comment?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 48: I think possibly they were sent to the press and not to me, so I can't answer them to the press.
Sentence 49: However, when I get them, I will see if they are entitled to an answer, and if they are they will get an answer.
Sentence 50: [5.]
Sentence 51: Q. Mr. President, when you referred to public power development in New England in your message,
4
were you referring to the Passamaquoddy tidal power or were you referring to river power?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: Both.
4 See Item 2.
Q.
Sentence 53: On that same line, how would you favor similar TVA development on the Cumberland River in Tennessee?
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: I am not familiar with that situation, and I can't answer that question.
Sentence 56: [6.]
Sentence 57: Q. Mr. President, I am in a high state of confusion concerning the--on that perennial St. Lawrence power and navigation project.
Sentence 58: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 59: What causes the confusion?
Sentence 60: Q. There have been a lot of maneuvers.
Sentence 61: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 62: What do you mean?
Sentence 63: Q.
Sentence 64: I don't know whether I can clear them up in this rapid fire question and answer, but I would like to explain a little bit about it to you, if you will permit me ?
Sentence 65: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: Sure, go right ahead.
Sentence 67: Q.
Sentence 68: You know some months ago the Ontario and New York power people got together on a proposal to develop power separately from the navigation, and you took the stand that it was all or nothing.
Sentence 69: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: That is correct, and I still am of that same frame of mind; all or nothing.
Sentence 71: Q.
Sentence 72: And that seemed effectively to put it on ice for a while, but while you were away, I think, they reactivated it over in the Federal power Commission.
Sentence 73: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: Well, I will never agree to the development of the St. Lawrence power project until the St. Lawrence Seaway project is attached to it.
Sentence 75: They go together.
Sentence 76: It should be developed together.
Sentence 77: That is for the interests of the whole United States, when it is developed that way.
Sentence 78: The other development is just for the interests of power in Ontario and the State of New York.
Sentence 79: And I want the whole country to have some good out of that development if we are going to pay for it.
Sentence 80: [7.]
Sentence 81: Q. Mr. President, for those of us who have been waiting for a full National Labor Relations Board, have you any news today?
Sentence 82: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 83: No, I haven't.
Sentence 84: Q. Have you any nominations at all that you might tell us?
Sentence 85: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 86: A whole batch of recess appointments today at noon.
Sentence 87: 5
Q. Recess appointments?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 88: Appointments that were made during recess.
Sentence 89: I am sending them up.
Sentence 90: We will give you a list of them.
5
Sentence 91: For the list of the President's nominations received by the Senate on January 5, see the Congressional Record (vol. 96, p. 106).
Sentence 92: Q.
Sentence 93: Any interesting ones that might make better news ?
Sentence 94: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 95: No.
Sentence 96: You have them all.
Sentence 97: [8.]
Sentence 98: Q. Mr. President, there are reports from out in Missouri as to whether you have endorsed the candidacy of State Senator Emery Allison for United States Senator ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 99: I know Emery Allison very well.
Sentence 100: I like him, and I think he would make a wonderful United States Senator from Missouri.
Sentence 101: When the primary comes around, I shall vote for him.
Sentence 102: Q. Where is he from, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 103: Where is he from?
Sentence 104: Rolla, Mo.
Sentence 105: He is the ranking Democratic member of the State Senate of Missouri.
Sentence 106: Q.
Sentence 107: How do you spell his name, sir ?
Sentence 108: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 109: A-l-l-i-s-o-n--but I am not sure whether it has two l's or not.
Sentence 110: E-m-e-r-y A-l-l-i-s-o-n. Whether it has two l's or not, I can't remember.
Sentence 111: [9.]
Sentence 112: Q. There is another power question I would like to ask you about?
Sentence 113: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 114: Shoot--go right ahead.
Sentence 115: Q. Do you favor development of Niagara power as well as the St. Lawrence ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 116: Oh, yes.
Sentence 117: I am for the development of all the power we can get in that corner of the United States.
Sentence 118: There are four great power projects in this country in which I am vitally interested.
Sentence 119: The Northeast power project, which includes New England developments, about which I was talking awhile ago, and the St. Lawrence.
Sentence 120: And the Northwest, which includes the Columbia and Snake River developments, and the Central Valley of California.
Sentence 121: And the Southwest, which includes Boulder Dam, and those projects in Texas and Oklahoma.
Sentence 122: And the southeast--northeast--northwest Arkansas, southwest Missouri, and northeast Oklahoma.
Sentence 123: And then the southeast development of the Tennessee Valley, and the Savannah, and the rivers in South Carolina on which we are building power projects.
Sentence 124: We will then have a network of power in the United States, and if we can get the three developments for the upper Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Valleys, we will have an inexhaustible supply of power, of which I think there can never be too much.
Q.
Sentence 125: In connection with that, are you figuring on the St. Lawrence Valley ?
Sentence 126: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 127: St. Lawrence Seaway.
Sentence 128: I want the St. Lawrence Seaway development all the way to Chicago, so that we can--and Duluth--so that we can tie up in Chicago.
Sentence 129: We have nothing at the docks in Chicago and Duluth.
Sentence 130: Q. I wonder whether you are in favor of a long-term TVA for that area?
Sentence 131: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 132: No, that will have to be a proposal carried out between the Governments of Canada and the United States, and the division of power in the United States will have to be under the control of the Federal Government.
Sentence 133: Q. Well, Mr. President, will you send a message on New England development?
Sentence 134: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 135: I probably will.
Sentence 136: As soon as possible, I probably will send a letter to the Congress on the subject.
Sentence 137: 6

See Item 33.
Sentence 138: [10.]
Sentence 139: Q. Mr. President, is it true that you plan to decide by February 15th on construction of a hydrogen-powered atomic bomb project?
Sentence 140: 7
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 141: I have no comment to make on that.
Sentence 142: 7 See Item 26.
Sentence 143: [11.]
Sentence 144: Q. Mr. President, in your message yesterday, I believe you did not mention the Missouri Valley Authority?
Sentence 145: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 146: Well, I am interested in the development of the Missouri, Mississippi, and Ohio Rivers as a project.
Sentence 147: I think they will--all three of them, the Mississippi, the Missouri, and the Ohio Rivers--will soon be developed as a central valley project for the United States.
Sentence 148: [12..]
Sentence 149: Q. Mr. President, do you favor Federal development of the Niagara River?
Sentence 150: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 151: What's that?
Sentence 152: Q. Federal development of the Niagara River?
Sentence 153: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 154: I want to make it a seaway of the St. Lawrence River.
Sentence 155: If the Niagara is included in that, why of course that will be all right.
Sentence 156: I don't think it is, though.
Sentence 157: I think there is a canal that goes around that still.
Sentence 158: Q.
Sentence 159: The United States and Canada are now conferring on power development in the Niagara River.
Sentence 160: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 161: The St. Lawrence development, I think, was our project, and I am for the development of the St. Lawrence Seaway power project.
Sentence 162: You can make it as broad as you want to.
Sentence 163: [13.]
Sentence 164: Q.
Sentence 165: In view of your comment on the Missouri election, do you have anybody in Ohio that you like the looks of?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 166: I don't dabble in primary politics in any State except Missouri.
Sentence 167: Q. Mr. President, in Pennsylvania Senator Myers is unopposed for the--the Democratic nomination for Senator.
Sentence 168: The Republicans, I believe, have a couple of boys that haven't been definitely announced.
Sentence 169: I was wondering if you are going into Pennsylvania to speak for Senator Myers?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 170: It won't be necessary for me to go into Pennsylvania in the primary.
Sentence 171: I don't care how much trouble the Republicans have in the primary.
Sentence 172: I hope the Democrats won't have any.
Sentence 173: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 174: I mean subsequently ?
Sentence 175: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 176: Well, I will answer that question when the time comes.
Sentence 177: [14.]
Sentence 178: Q. Mr. President, I would like to get this Missouri Valley thing straightened out.
Sentence 179: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 180: Shoot.
Sentence 181: Q. Is it your idea that the Pick-Sloan plan
8
will eventually envelop the Missouri Valley Authority ?
Sentence 182: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 183: Yes.
Sentence 184: Yes.
Sentence 185: I am very sure it will.
Sentence 186: 8 Joint plan for the division of responsibility in the Missouri Valley between the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation.
Sentence 187: The Engineer Corps was given responsibility for determining the capacities of main-stem and tributary reservoirs for flood control and navigation.
Sentence 188: The Bureau assumed responsibility for determining the capacities of reservoirs for irrigation purposes.
Sentence 189: The plan was approved by Congress on December 22, 1944 (see.
Sentence 190: 9, 58 Stat. 891).
Sentence 191: However, the Congress did not approve President Roosevelt's request for the creation of a Missouri Valley Authority.
Sentence 192: Q.
Sentence 193: That is your idea, that eventually Pick-Sloan will--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 194: Will develop all the Missouri Valley Authority.
Sentence 195: Then I want to develop the Mississippi and Ohio in conjunction with the suggestion covering the whole valley.
Sentence 196: Q.
Sentence 197: Now then, on the Missouri, will you have an authority--an administration for the pick-Sloan plan, or will you still have--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 198: We will cross that bridge when we get to it.
Sentence 199: I am not ready to go into detail on it at all.
Sentence 200: There has been too much detail on it now.
Sentence 201: That is the reason we are having trouble with it.
Sentence 202: You have got nine Governors of nine States on that river.
Sentence 203: [15.]
Sentence 204: Q. Mr. President, one more question in answer to Mrs. Craig's?
9
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 205: Sure.
Sentence 206: 9 Mrs. May Craig of the Portland (Maine) Press Herald.
Sentence 207: Q.
Sentence 208: You said that you were covering the plan with a letter.
Sentence 209: Does that apply solely to Northeast power, or the whole project?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 210: That applies to New England.
Sentence 211: We have already made a statement on the St. Lawrence Seaway and power project.
Sentence 212: I am anxious to see that there is proper development of power in the New England area.
Sentence 213: [16.]

Sentence 227: Q.
Sentence 228: The same for small business?
Sentence 229: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 230: Yes.
Sentence 231: They cover both.
Sentence 232: Can't have one without the other.
Sentence 233: [17.]
Sentence 234: Q. Mr. President, how do you like the reaction to your message yesterday?
Sentence 235: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 236: It was fine.
Sentence 237: I told you that yesterday as I came out.
Sentence 238: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, how did you like the Republican response to your reference to the--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 239: I was highly pleased when they turned that into an ovation for me.
Sentence 240: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, do you expect a similar ovation when you explain how much a moderate tax increase is ?
Sentence 241: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 242: Yes.
Sentence 243: Yes, I do.
Sentence 244: Especially from the Democrats.
Sentence 245: [18.]
Sentence 246: Q. Are you encouraged to go back to Key West again this winter?
Sentence 247: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 248: Well, I don't know whether I can go or not.
Sentence 249: I would if I could.
Sentence 250: Mighty nice place to be when you want plenty of sunlight.
Sentence 251: They tell me it is going down to zero here pretty soon.
Sentence 252: I suppose we will all want to go where it is warm.
Sentence 253: What did you ask me?
Sentence 254: [19.]
Sentence 255: Q. There was a rise in stock market prices, I noticed, after you spoke.
Sentence 256: Do you regard that as one of the good reactions--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 257: Well, I don't--I can't comment on that because I didn't pay any attention to that.
Sentence 258: I wasn't making a speech to affect the stock market.
Sentence 259: [Laughter] It was in the public interest.
Sentence 260: [20.]
Sentence 261: Q. Was Speaker Rayburn's remark about the size of the budget intentional, or a slip, or--
12
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 262: Well now, I can't answer for Speaker Rayburn.
Sentence 263: Why don't you ask him that question?
Sentence 264: The budget will go down--the Budget Message will go down Monday morning--Monday at noon--whenever the Congress meets, and we will have the seminar on the Budget on Saturday morning,
13
and you will know just as much about it as I do.
Sentence 265: I am not going to discuss it now.
Sentence 266: 12
As reported in the press, the Speaker saw the new budget during a White House conference on January 3, after which he stated that the budget would call for an expenditure of "a little above $42 billion.
Sentence 267: "
13
See Item 8..
Sentence 268: [21.]
Sentence 269: Q. Mr. President, your reference to the power development in the big river basins was largely in terms of electric power.
Sentence 270: You have in mind, I presume, more general multipurpose development?
Sentence 271: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 272: The principal development in the central valley of the Missouri, Mississippi, and Ohio is navigation and flood control.
Sentence 273: Up as far as Sioux City, Iowa, on the Missouri, there is no possible power for that particular project except maybe on some of the branches.
Sentence 274: The Missouri River carries more sediment than any other river in the world except the Danube, and if you would attempt to build a dam from bluff to bluff on the Missouri River, right below Sioux City, Iowa, it wouldn't be but about a year and a half and you would have lots of mud behind the dam, and you would have a fall there.
Sentence 275: The development of the Missouri, Ohio, and the Mississippi are projects that will have to be worked out as the features of the ground reveal its condition.
Sentence 276: Q. Speaking of the Ohio Valley, how far up the river would you go in the development of it?
Sentence 277: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 278: Do you know where the Ohio originates?
Sentence 279: At Pittsburgh, where the Alleghenies come together, where there are now some flood control and power dams on the Monongahela River.
Sentence 280: And the way to control floods is to control the little rivers, and that will have to be done all over that valley in order to control the floods.
Sentence 281: Q.
Sentence 282: That is mainly a flood control proposition for the Ohio Valley ?
Sentence 283: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 284: That is the most important part of the development.
Sentence 285: [22.]
Sentence 286: Q. You have made recommendations several times on the Central Valley of California?
Sentence 287: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 288: The valley of California-Central Valley of California, yes.
Sentence 289: I am in the same frame of mind as I am for the rest of these developments.
Sentence 290: I want to see a Central Valley Authority from Shasta Dam all the way up to the San Bernadino Mountains.
Sentence 291: [23.]
Sentence 292: Q. Where there are expensive details of construction, whom do you want to transmit the power ?
Sentence 293: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 294: Where it is necessary, the United States Government.
Sentence 295: Where private industry can do it as cheaply as the United States Government, I am happy to have them do it.
Sentence 296: [24.]
Sentence 297: Q. Mr. President, do you plan to find out the type of authority for that Savannah Valley in the southeast?
Sentence 298: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 299: I hadn't given that any thought.
Sentence 300: Q. Merely want the dam built?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 301: I want power developed, principally.
Sentence 302: [25.]
Sentence 303: Q. Mr. President, do you anticipate any real coordination on these three river valleys in your present term of office?
Sentence 304: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 305: Which three do you mean?
Sentence 306: Q.
Sentence 307: The Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio?
Sentence 308: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 309: That is a tremendous project--will cost about a billion and a half dollars.
Sentence 310: If it should be, it will have to come more or less gradually.
Sentence 311: We have already spent a billion, 250 million.
Sentence 312: It is about time we did some developments--
Reporter:
Sentence 313: Thank you, Mr. President.
