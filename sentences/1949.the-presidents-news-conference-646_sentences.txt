Sentence 38: I don't know anything about it.
Sentence 39: You will have to ask Governor Lehman.
Sentence 40: He made the decision, not I.
Sentence 41: He wrote me and recommended a judge to me, and I answered his letter and told him that I had heard he was going to run for the Senate and I would be pleased if he did.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 133: Yes, that is just as plain as it can possibly be.
