Sentence 1: 1948 The Presidents News Conference 378

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have no announcements to make this morning.
Sentence 3: If you have any questions you think I can answer, I will be glad to try to answer them.
Sentence 4: [1.]
Sentence 5: Q. Mr. President, there's lots being made up on the Hill over some reported secret papers of the State Department stolen.
Sentence 6: These papers are now figuring quite voluminously in the Communist investigation.
Sentence 7: Do you know of any reason why those papers, dating back to the late thirties should not be made public now?
Sentence 8: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 9: That matter is in the hands of the Attorney General and the courts.
Sentence 10: I have no comment to make on that.
Sentence 11: Q. Mr. President, there does seem to be indisputable evidence, despite all the bizarre aspects of the case, that highly secret and confidential documents were stolen from the State Department files--taken out long enough to be microfilmed and then put back in the State Department files.
Sentence 12: Do you think, sir, that all our arms of Government should be used to find out if possible who stole those documents?
Sentence 13: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 14: Why certainly.
Sentence 15: The Attorney General will do that.
Sentence 16: It is in his hands.
Sentence 17: Q. Mr. President, last night at the night hearing, Acting Chairman Mundt
1
accused the administration of being a "do-nothing" administration.
Sentence 18: Would you care--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 19: That's a "me too" proposition.
Sentence 20: 1
Representative Karl E. Mundt of South Dakota, Acting Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.
Sentence 21: Q. A what proposition?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 22: A "me too" proposition.
Sentence 23: Q. Mr. President, have you given any instructions to the Department of Justice on this case?
Sentence 24: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: The Department of Justice has had standing instructions on the whole thing, ever since it started.
Sentence 26: Q.
Sentence 27: What were those instructions, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 28: It's what the Attorney General's duties are, to enforce the law.
Sentence 29: Q. I thought, sir, you meant they had instructions from you?
Sentence 30: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 31: No. Of course the Attorney General discussed the matter with me at various times, and he has of course had instructions to enforce the law.
Sentence 32: Q. Mr. President, do you still feel that this--as you did during the late summer, that this congressional investigation has the aspects of a "red herring"?
Sentence 33: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 34: That's what the people thought.
Sentence 35: Q.
Sentence 36: Do you think so now, sir?
Sentence 37: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: I do.
Sentence 39: Q.
Sentence 40: After these revelations that the documents were stolen?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 41: I certainly do.
Sentence 42: If they were in dead earnest, they would have taken this matter to the Attorney General and let him go ahead with the prosecution.
Sentence 43: They aren't prosecuting anybody, they are just making headlines.
Sentence 44: Q. Mr. President, the committee members said they have repeatedly taken action with the Attorney General in all of its aspects.
Sentence 45: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 46: That's not what the Attorney General said.
Sentence 47: Q. Mr. President, are you at all interested in this charge of Mr. Nixon's,
1
that the Department of Justice proposes to indict only Chambers
2
--or first Chambers, and thus destroy his usefulness?
1
Representative Richard M. Nixon of California.
Sentence 48: 2
Whittaker Chambers, witness before congressional committees on Communist espionage in the United States.
Sentence 49: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 50: The Department of Justice will follow the law.
Sentence 51: It's in the hands of the Department of Justice and the courts, and that's where it will be, so far as I am concerned.
Sentence 52: I have no intention of getting into a controversy with this dead committee.
Sentence 53: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 54: My question may be useless, after that, but there is a charge that there's politics being played at this hearing, and the inference is that the administration is playing the politics.
Sentence 55: You said nothing about that.
Sentence 56: May I ask you if you will say something about it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 57: I think the evidence speaks for itself on that--in that line.
Sentence 58: Q. Mr. President, may I ask one thing?
Sentence 59: You call it a dead committee.
Sentence 60: It's a standing committee of the House.
Sentence 61: Do you think it will be, or should be abolished.
Sentence 62: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: I think the Congress itself will take care of that when it meets after the first of January, so you had better ask the Speaker of the House what he intends to do about it.
Sentence 64: Q. Mr. President, does it disturb you at all, sir, that although the FBI had the Chambers story for 9 years, it took this dead committee to come up with the documents?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 65: Did the FBI have it for 9 years, do you know?
Sentence 66: Are you making that as a statement of fact?
Sentence 67: I want to know if you know that?
Sentence 68: I don't know--I say I don't know that that is a fact.
Sentence 69: I don't think you should enter into a controversy unless you know it is a fact.
Sentence 70: Q. Did you say--you said that it is not a fact, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 71: I do not.
Sentence 72: I don't think you do, either.
Sentence 73: Q. Mr. President, the testimony has been that although--not the FBI necessarily, but other high officers, including Mr. Berle
1
in the Democratic administration, had heard the whole story?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: I know nothing about it.
Sentence 75: 1
Adolf A. Berle, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of State.
Sentence 76: Q. Mr. President, may I ask one more question--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 77: Shoot.
Q.--on the same topic?
Sentence 78: That is, the trial of the 12 Communist leaders has been postponed 2 or 3 times, and I wonder whether any thought or conclusion had been had as to whether that prosecution is to be pressed, or whether it might even be dropped?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: That is a question you had better ask the Attorney General.
Sentence 80: He has instructions to go ahead and prosecute all the lawbreakers of that sort.
Sentence 81: [2.]
Sentence 82: Q. Mr. President, is Judge Waring
1
of South Carolina being considered for another appointment?

Sentence 87: Q. Mr. President, could you dear up for us in any way the status of this Chiefs of Staff Evaluation Board Bikini atom bomb experiment?
Sentence 88: 2
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: I can clear it up as it has always been cleared up; its status hasn't changed and will not change.
Sentence 90: 2
See Item 278
Sentence 91: [1].
Sentence 92: Q.
Sentence 93: That's on the recommendation of Secretary Forrestal that it will not be published?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 94: That's right.
Sentence 95: Q.
Sentence 96: There are several indications that there will be no objection from the Department of Defense, or even from the Atomic Energy--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: There might be an objection from the President, and it rests in my desk.
Sentence 98: [4.]
Sentence 99: Q.
Sentence 100: If the delegate to the United Nations, Mr. Austin, should resign, would you invite a Member of the Congress to succeed him?
Sentence 101: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 102: Now that's a possibility I haven't considered.
Sentence 103: I know nothing about Senator Austin having any intention of resigning.
Sentence 104: You will have to find that out first.
Sentence 105: [5.]
Sentence 106: Q. Mr. President, are the Baltic refugees who came across the Atlantic in a small boat this summer going to be returned to Sweden?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: I am trying my best not to have them returned.
Sentence 108: I have been working on that right along.
Sentence 109: I hope that they will not have to be returned.
Sentence 110: Q.

Sentence 121: Q.
Sentence 122: The Army announced at the time that the papers were asked for--for you?
Sentence 123: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 124: I knew nothing about it.
Sentence 125: That may have been asked for in my name, which the Secretary of Defense has a perfect right to do.
Sentence 126: [7.]
Sentence 127: Q. Mr. President, can you give us any idea yet when you will have your budget seminar?

Sentence 147: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 148: I don't think I am going to be able to go.
Sentence 149: I would like very much to go, because I have been very much interested in the Government of Puerto Rico, and appointed the first native Governor, and I had hoped to be present at the inauguration of their first elected Governor; but Congress in all probability will meet on the 3d, and I don't think I can leave.
Sentence 150: [11.]
