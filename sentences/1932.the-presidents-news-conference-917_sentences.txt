THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: The issue before the country is the reestablishment of confidence and speed towards recovery by ending these delays in balancing the budget through immediate passage of the new measures for reduction of Government expense.
Sentence 3: That is not a partisan issue.
Sentence 4: It was one of the most important steps in the nonpartisan program for restored stability that was proposed by me and patriotically accepted by the leaders of both political parties last December.
Sentence 5: Effective programs, projects, estimates, and possibilities for both economy and revenue have been presented and are known in every detail.
Sentence 6: This is not a controversey between the President and the Congress or its Members.
Sentence 7: It is an issue of the people against delays and destructive legislation which impair the credit of the United States.
Sentence 8: It is also an issue between the people and the locust swarm of lobbyists that haunt the Halls of Congress seeking selfish privilege for special groups and sections of the country, and misleading Members on the real views of the people by showers of propaganda.
Sentence 9: What is urgently required is immediate action upon and conclusion of these questions.
Sentence 10: This is a serious hour which demands that all elements of the Government and the people rise with stern courage above partisanship to meet the needs of our national life.
