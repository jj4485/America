Sentence 1: 1949 The Presidents News Conference 650

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I have a statement I would like to read to you on a thing that has been taking place recently.
Sentence 4: Q. Will it be available after, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 5: It will be available.
Sentence 6: It's all set up for you here.
Sentence 7: Plenty of copies, so that each one of you can have one.
Sentence 8: The reason I want to read it to you is because I think it is a very important statement.
Sentence 9: It will clear up a great many things about which there has been so much conjecture.
Sentence 10: Q. Will you read it slowly, please, sir?
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 12: Yes, I will.
Sentence 13: [Laughter] I will try to read it as slowly as I can.
Sentence 14: [Reading, not literally] "On July 14th I consulted with a group of congressional leaders, including ranking members of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, concerning certain problems which this country faces in the field of atomic energy.
Sentence 15: Since that time, members of the administration have held discussions with congressional leaders, particularly with the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.
Sentence 16: Further discussions will take place, as it is essential that action in this field which so vitally affects the security of the country be based on a wide area of agreement between the executive and the legislative branches of the Government.
Sentence 17: "In this field, it is important that the people of the country be kept informed as to the greatest extent--to the greatest extent consistent with the requirements of the national security, and in a manner consistent with the orderly processes of consultation between the legislative and executive branches of the Government.
Sentence 18: I feel I can now mention briefly some of the factors involved in the problem.
Sentence 19: "As a result of consultations among American, British, and Canadian scientists, beginning in 1939, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada agreed in 1943 to concentrate a major effort in the United States, for the purpose of producing an atomic bomb at the earliest possible time.
Sentence 20: A British scientific mission participated extensively in the research and development, and later in the production of atomic bombs at Los Alamos.
Sentence 21: They participated in the preparation for, and the evaluation of, the Bikini tests.
Sentence 22: Similar scientific missions were assigned to research and development work concerned with the construction and operation of the principal plants for the separation of U-235 at Oak Ridge.
Sentence 23: British and Canadian scientists consulted our scientific and technical personnel at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago on the design of the heavy water reactor which they subsequently built at Chalk River, Canada.
Sentence 24: "Early in 1947 the three countries adopted a uniform system for handling the information which has been jointly developed for determining what should be kept secret, and what was appropriate for public release.
Sentence 25: "In January 1948 the three governments agreed upon a modus vivendi which provided for cooperation among the three countries involving exchange of scientific and technical information in certain defined areas and collaboration on matters of raw material supply of common concern.
Sentence 26: These arrangements were made after consultation with the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.
Sentence 27: These arrangements are limited in scope and duration.
Sentence 28: It is necessary to consider the future, taking into account the developments made in this field by the three countries, and to maintain the status quo while this consideration takes place.
Sentence 29: "We, therefore, intend to explore with the United Kingdom and Canada some of the basic questions underlying any determination of long range policy in this field.
Sentence 30: These are questions which will require further consultations with the Congress following the exploratory conversations.
Sentence 31: I wish to emphasize that these exploratory conversations do not involve making agreements with or commitments to the British and Canadians on these questions.
Sentence 32: They involve having talks with the British and Canadians prior to further consultations with the Congress.
Sentence 33: In these consultations with the Congress, we shall have to decide together what course of action it is wisest to take.
Sentence 34: "
That's all.
Sentence 35: I think when you read it carefully you will find that it is a perfectly logical statement.
Sentence 36: Nothing mysterious about it, nor has there ever been.
Sentence 37: Q. Why were all those fellows running out of there with their faces hanging down to the curb?
Sentence 38: They all looked so gloomy--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 39: Well--
Q.--remember?
THE PRESIDENT.--it's a gloomy subject.
Sentence 40: It's a gloomy subject.
Sentence 41: This atomic explosion is one which we all dread, myself more than anybody else, because I never want to have to use it again.
Sentence 42: Q.
Sentence 43: You said that you never want to use it again.
Sentence 44: May we use that for quotes?
Sentence 45: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 46: Yes--I have said that time and again.
Sentence 47: I never want to have to use it again.
Sentence 48: Any questions?
Sentence 49: [2.]
Sentence 50: Q. Mr. President, I want to ask you, do you--I know you are not intervening in Democratic primaries in any State--I just wondered if you have a favorite candidate in Virginia, or a curbstone opinion on who should be elected?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 51: No comment.
Sentence 52: I don't intervene in State politics.
Sentence 53: [3.]
Sentence 54: Q. Mr. President, Colonel Renfrow, who is an assistant, I believe, in General Vaughan's office, said in a speech out--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: He is an Assistant to the Secretary of Defense.
Sentence 56: Q. Secretary of Defense--said out in Grand Rapids that you may appoint somebody from Chicago to head up a civilian military thing--a sort of vague reference.
Sentence 57: Are you contemplating somebody from Chicago?
Sentence 58: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 59: Not that I know of.
Sentence 60: Nothing in contemplation at the present time.
Sentence 61: [4.]
Sentence 62: Q. Mr. President, have you arrived near the point where you will nominate a Supreme Court Associate Justice?
Sentence 63: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: Yes, and I can tell you who it is, if you want to know.
Sentence 65: Q. Oh!
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: It's Tom Clark, the Attorney General.
Sentence 67: And I shall make Howard McGrath the Attorney General.
Sentence 68: I called them in this morning and made the proposition to them, and they were both so surprised at being called upon that they couldn't give me an answer.
Sentence 69: They promised to give me an answer in a few days.
Sentence 70: Q.
Sentence 71: You expect an answer in a few days?
Sentence 72: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 73: Yes, I expect their answer in a few days.
Sentence 74: Q. Are you going to hold up the nomination until you see the answer?
Sentence 75: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: Until they give me the go-forward sign, I won't know that they will accept.
Sentence 77: Q.
Sentence 78: You said Attorney General Clark was surprised?
Sentence 79: THE PRESIDENT, Yes sir--very much surprised.
Sentence 80: Q. I called him "Judge" the other day, and he seemed to be very much pleased.
Sentence 81: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 82: You didn't make it a high enough rank.
Sentence 83: You should have called him "Mr. Justice," if you really had that in mind.
Sentence 84: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 85: What would be your best guess?
Sentence 86: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: My best guess is, of course, that they will accept.
Sentence 88: Of course I expect they will.
Sentence 89: Q. Are you awaiting a reply from both gentlemen?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 90: Yes, I am awaiting a reply from both gentlemen.
Sentence 91: Q. Was that this morning?
Sentence 92: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 93: This morning.
Sentence 94: Q.
Sentence 95: Do you think it possible that they won't accept?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: That is for you to speculate on.
Sentence 97: You are going to have 3 or 4 days in which to do it.
Sentence 98: Q. Were they in this morning, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 99: Yes, they were in this morning.
Sentence 100: Q.
Sentence 101: We didn't see them come in.
Sentence 102: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 103: No, and you didn't see them go out.
Sentence 104: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, you said you met them this morning?
Sentence 105: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 106: They came in here this morning.
Sentence 107: They came at my request.
Sentence 108: Q. Mr. President, that would mean that Senator McGrath would have to quit as national chairman, wouldn't it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 109: I don't know about that.
Sentence 110: He will have to resign from the Senate if he is confirmed.
Sentence 111: Q.
Sentence 112: That makes Bill Boyle chairman of the Democratic National Committee, wouldn't it?
Sentence 113: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 114: Go on and do your speculating all you want.
Sentence 115: I have no comment to make on that at all.
Sentence 116: Q. Make a mighty good one.
Sentence 117: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 118: No comment.
Sentence 119: [5.]
Sentence 120: Q. Mr. President, we understood that there might be a story growing out of the presence of Jonathan Daniels?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 121: What do you mean?
Sentence 122: What kind of story?
Sentence 123: Q.
Sentence 124: I don't know.
Sentence 125: He's here.
Sentence 126: THE PRESIDENT
Sentence 127: [to Mr. Daniels].
Sentence 128: Jonathan, do you know of any reason--
Mr. Daniels: I don't know--
THE PRESIDENT.--why you shouldn't be here, if I invited you to come in?
Sentence 129: [Laughter]
Jonathan used to run these press conferences, if I am not mistaken.
Sentence 130: He likes to see them go still.
Sentence 131: [6.]
Sentence 132: Q. Mr. President, do you feel that there should be a member of the major minority faith on the Supreme Court?
Sentence 133: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 134: I don't think faith has anything to do with a Justice of the Supreme Court.
Sentence 135: If he is qualified, I wouldn't care what his faith is, whether it's Catholic, Baptist, or Jewish.
Sentence 136: If he is qualified, that is the only thing that I consider.
Sentence 137: [7.]
Sentence 138: Q. Mr. President, on the picket lines in front of the White House for several days--would you like to comment on that?
Sentence 139: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 140: I don't know anything about any such picket lines.
Sentence 141: If I did, I wouldn't comment on it.
Sentence 142: [8.]
Sentence 143: Q. Do you have any comment on the controversy between Cardinal Spellman and Mrs. Roosevelt?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 144: No comment.
Sentence 145: Well taken care of in the press, and I have no comment.
