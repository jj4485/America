Sentence 1: 1941 Press Conference 6

THE PRESIDENT: There are only two things I can think of for you.
Sentence 2: One is that because it is perfectly obvious that so much tonnage in the way of ships has been going to the bottom for a year and a half, probably at the end of the war, sooner or later, there will be a shortage—a world shortage—of tonnage.
Sentence 3: Therefore we have begun taking the first steps toward a program of building about 200 merchant ships—a program which will cost somewhere around $300,000,000, between $300,000,000 and $350,000,000, in a number of new plants.
Sentence 4: This is on the general theory that there has been a tremendous expansion in existing shipbuilding plants, as you all know; and the time seems to have come when it is advisable to create some new plants.
Sentence 5: Toward that program, in order to get started, I have taken $36,000,000 out of the President's Special Contract Authorization Fund.
Sentence 6: The other thing:—I expect next week to send to the Senate a name for Ambassador to Great Britain; but in the meantime I am asking Harry Hopkins to go over as my personal representative for a very short trip to the other side, just to maintain—I suppose that is the best word for it—personal contact between me and the British Government.
Sentence 7: He will only be over there a couple of weeks, and then come back here.
Sentence 8: Q. Does Mr. Hopkins have any special mission, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 9: No, no, no!
Q.
Sentence 10: Any title?
THE PRESIDENT: No, no!
Q. Is that $300,000,000 to be for constructing new yards, or actual construction of ships?
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT: Actual construction.
Sentence 12: Q. Where will the majority of the new yards be?
Sentence 13: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 14: I thought I would not bring that subject up, because if I were to say now one were to go to the State of X and another to the State of Y, they would at once try to get them away.
Sentence 15: Q. How will the new shipbuilding yards be financed?
Sentence 16: THE PRESIDENT: Out of this $36,000,000.
Sentence 17: Some of you older people remember a place called Squantum that I built in 1917 on the marshes between Boston and Fall River, near Quincy, Massachusetts.
Sentence 18: Actually, the shipyard itself cost very little, because it was more a question of driving a lot of piles for the ways and putting a nice tin shed over the ways and putting in some light construction shops.
Sentence 19: It is not an expensive type of plant for this type of ship.
Sentence 20: Q. Will this work be done entirely by existing shipbuilding companies?
Sentence 21: THE PRESIDENT: Not necessarily, no.
Sentence 22: Q. Will the Government own the ships?
Sentence 23: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 24: Yes; that is a question of working it out.
Sentence 25: Q. One more question; you may not wish to answer it, but I am interested in the old Morris Shipbuilding Company in Connecticut.
Sentence 26: THE PRESIDENT: I honestly don't know.
Sentence 27: There was some talk of reviving it when we were up there in New London.
Sentence 28: We went right by the old Morris plant; but whether there is enough salvage material there or enough labor supply, I don't know.
Sentence 29: Q. Are there others of the old World War plants that are in the same condition?
Sentence 30: I have in mind Hog Island.
Sentence 31: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 32: At Hog Island there is nothing left.
Sentence 33: There is an old plant that was running in World War days on the Hudson River, at Newburgh.
Sentence 34: Some of the piling and docks have rotted away; the buildings are still there.
Sentence 35: That is being studied, whether it is worth while to rehabilitate them.
Sentence 36: Q. How long does it take, generally speaking, to build one of those shipyards?
Sentence 37: THE PRESIDENT: I hate to be categorical on that.
Sentence 38: Suppose you figure it out this way, that we ought to get ships inside of a year.
Sentence 39: Q. Mr. President, is the Maritime Commission supervising this?
Sentence 40: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 41: Yes.
Sentence 42: Q.
Sentence 43: What design of ships?
Sentence 44: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 45: Anyone of you that knows a ship and loves a ship would hate them, as I do.
Sentence 46: In other words, they are the type of ship that is built by the yard or the foot.
Sentence 47: Nobody that loves ships can be very proud of them; but it gets them out, and the difference, roughly speaking, in time between building a ship that is built like a square, oblong tank and a ship that is really a ship is six or eight months.
Sentence 48: In other words, by building this dreadful looking object you save six or eight months.
Sentence 49: Q. Mr. President, when is Mr. Hopkins going to London?
Sentence 50: THE PRESIDENT: Very soon.
Sentence 51: Q.
Sentence 52: What is the total tonnage of these ships involved, could you say?
Sentence 53: THE PRESIDENT: I think— I may not be exactly correct—I think, roughly, about 7500 tons each.
Sentence 54: Q. Mr. President, will there be any prefabrication of parts?
Sentence 55: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 56: Yes, we'll do all we can in the steel plant and have the shipyard itself, as much as possible, merely an assembly plant. . . .
Sentence 57: Q. Will consideration be given to construction in places where the Government already owns property?
Sentence 58: THE PRESIDENT: I cannot think of any such place.
Sentence 59: Q.
Sentence 60: We mentioned Hog Island; the Government still holds a large amount of land there.
Sentence 61: THE PRESIDENT: There are other considerations—labor supply and things of that kind.
Sentence 62: Q. Have we sufficient skilled labor to build them?
Sentence 63: THE PRESIDENT: Probably so.
Sentence 64: Q.
Sentence 65: There will not be any training programs for this, will there?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 66: Yes, like everything else; we are training people for all kinds of things.
Sentence 67: I think NYA alone, as a Government proposition, is training about 300,000 people at this moment.
Sentence 68: In addition to that, you have a great many people that are being trained under the supervision of labor unions; you have an enormous number of people being trained in private plants.
Sentence 69: The total is very large.
Sentence 70: Q. Mr. President, in connection with the ships, there was a morning story in London suggesting that we were going to give more ships to Britain.
Sentence 71: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 72: A morning-paper story?
Sentence 73: Q. Yes.
Sentence 74: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 75: That's what it sounds like.
Sentence 76: (Laughter)
Sentence 77: Q. Mr. President, with regard to Mr. Hopkins, you said he was going over as personal representative; will he have a status of ambassador?
Sentence 78: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 79: No, he has no status at all; he is going over as my representative.
Sentence 80: The question of title doesn't enter into it.
Sentence 81: Q.
Sentence 82: You said next week you would name the new ambassador; does that mean a name has been submitted?
Sentence 83: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 84: No.
Sentence 85: Q.
Sentence 86: Mr. President, is it safe to say Mr. Hopkins will not be the next Ambassador?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 87: You know Harry isn't strong enough for that job.
Sentence 88: Q. Will he be on the Government pay roll?
Sentence 89: THE PRESIDENT: I suppose they will pay his expenses—probably a per diem, not very large—either for you or Hopkins!
Sentence 90: (Laughter)
Sentence 91: Q. Has the date of his departure been fixed?
Sentence 92: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Q. Has Mr. Kennedy's resignation become effective?
Sentence 93: THE PRESIDENT: Not yet.
Sentence 94: Q. Will it be effective on Mr. Hopkins' going over?
Sentence 95: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 96: No.
Q. Will anyone accompany Mr. Hopkins?
Sentence 97: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 98: No.
Sentence 99: And he will have no powers.
Sentence 100: Q. Will he have any mission to perform?
Sentence 101: THE PRESIDENT: No; you can't get anything exciting.
Sentence 102: (Laughter)
Sentence 103: He's just going over to say "How do you do?"
Sentence 104: to a lot of my friends!
Sentence 105: (Laughter)
Q. There have been some unofficial complaints from Sweden about your reference Sunday night to the fact that they were sending materials to Germany.
Sentence 106: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 107: I'll give you something—off the record.
Sentence 108: This is what happened: In the draft— No. 6 draft, I think it was-I had it worded in such a way that it took half a page—half a typewritten page.
Sentence 109: This is off the record; it has to be.
Sentence 110: You see how these things happen.
Sentence 111: I had explained that Sweden, under a form of duress—that is the word I used originally, which would be certainly true—was sending iron, steel, into Germany every day.
Sentence 112: It was perfectly true; it was a form of duress.
Sentence 113: I went on and I said, in the case of Rumania, it was oil, and that is again a form of duress.
Sentence 114: I came to the case of Russia.
Sentence 115: Well, that probably is not duress; that is a question of Russian policy, because it is an awfully big country; and I left out the word "duress" in the case of Russia.
Sentence 116: And then I bumped into the awful problem of what is the status of supplies going into Germany from Yugoslavia.
Sentence 117: Is that duress or not?
Sentence 118: I got so involved in trying to explain the status of supplies going to Germany from different nations near Germany, and I needed to save space anyway, so I put it all into one sentence, and left out what the reason was behind the supplies going in.
Sentence 119: Of course the reason differs in almost every country.
Sentence 120: I just lumped it and called it "Sweden, Russia, and other nations near Germany"; and the fact remains that the supplies are going in.
Sentence 121: So that is what happened.
Sentence 122: That is the story of the sentence.
Sentence 123: Q. Mr. President, do you consider that the steel supply-the present steel supply—is adequate for the shipbuilding program?
Sentence 124: THE PRESIDENT: I hope so.
Sentence 125: In other words, you know perfectly well on this question of this, that, and the other shortage, taking steel for instance, that we got the very best advice we could on steel way back last autumn, from people who know steel.
Sentence 126: They said there were ample steel production facilities in the United States.
Sentence 127: We told them, "Hold on, now, you may have more steel to turn out—plates, ships, et cetera—than you think."
Sentence 128: They said, "We still think we have ample.
Sentence 129: "
This went on until October or November.
Sentence 130: It wasn't their fault; but the program itself developed faster than they thought.
Sentence 131: In November I insisted that they review the whole situation, and then they came to believe that additional steel production was necessary, and since then they have picked up.
Sentence 132: For instance, Tennessee Coal and Iron is putting in 400,000 tons; Bethlehem is putting in 800,000, and they are adding another 800,000 for our glass furnaces and things like that; so probably the production has been increased about 2,000,000 tons of steel a year.
Sentence 133: I think on this—
Q.
Sentence 134: [interposing] Beginning when?
Sentence 135: It takes 18 months to build a glass furnace.
Sentence 136: THE PRESIDENT: That is a thing I am trying to cut.
Sentence 137: In this we probably have enough to turn out the ships and plates.
Sentence 138: It is very simple work.
Sentence 139: On the general question whether we shall have to increase steel production facilities, I expect a report within two or three days, and it looks as if we would have to increase the facilities. . . .
