Sentence 1: 1948 The Presidents News Conference 344

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have a short statement I want to read to you to begin with.
Sentence 3: Then we will have questions, if you feel like it.
Sentence 4: [1.]
Sentence 5: [Reading] "It is vital that the American people have a clear understanding of the position of the United States in the United Nations regarding Palestine.
Sentence 6: "
This will be mimeographed and ready for you when you leave.
Sentence 7: "This country vigorously supported the plan for partition with economic union recommended by the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine and by the General Assembly.
Sentence 8: We have explored every possibility consistent with the basic principles of the Charter for giving effect to that solution.
Sentence 9: Unfortunately, it has become clear that the partition plan cannot be carried out at this time by peaceful means.
Sentence 10: We could not undertake to impose this solution on the people of Palestine by the use of American troops, both on Charter grounds and as a matter of national policy.
Sentence 11: "The United Kingdom has announced its firm intention to abandon its mandate in Palestine on May 15.
Sentence 12: Unless emergency action is taken, there will be no public authority in Palestine on that date capable of preserving law and order.
Sentence 13: Violence and bloodshed will descend upon the Holy Land.
Sentence 14: Large scale fighting among the people of that country will be the inevitable result.
Sentence 15: Such fighting would infect the entire Middle East and could lead to consequences of the gravest sort involving the peace of this Nation and of the world.
Sentence 16: "These dangers are imminent.
Sentence 17: Responsible governments in the United Nations cannot face this prospect without acting promptly to prevent it.
Sentence 18: The United States has proposed to the Security Council a temporary United Nations trusteeship for Palestine to provide a government to keep the peace.
Sentence 19: Such trusteeship was proposed only after we had exhausted every effort to find a way to carry out partition by peaceful means.
Sentence 20: Trusteeship is not proposed as a substitute for the partition plan but as an effort to fill the vacuum soon to be created by the termination of the mandate on May 15.
Sentence 21: The trusteeship does not prejudice the character of the final political settlement.
Sentence 22: It would establish the conditions of order which are essential to a peaceful solution.
Sentence 23: "If we are to avert tragedy in Palestine, an immediate truce must be reached between the Arabs and Jews of that country.
Sentence 24: I am instructing Ambassador Austin to urge upon the Security Council in the strongest terms that representatives of the Arabs and Jews be called at once to the Council table to arrange such a truce.
Sentence 25: "The United States is prepared to lend every appropriate assistance to the United Nations in preventing bloodshed and in reaching a peaceful settlement.
Sentence 26: If the United Nations agrees to a temporary trusteeship, we must take our share of the necessary responsibility.
Sentence 27: Our regard for the United Nations, for the peace of the world, and for our own self-interest, does not permit us to do less.
Sentence 28: "With such a truce and such a trusteeship, a peaceful settlement is yet possible, and without them open warfare is just over the horizon.
Sentence 29: American policy in this emergency period is based squarely upon the recognition of this inescapable fact.
Sentence 30: "
Q. Mr. President, does the responsibility to back up the U.N. trusteeship plan include the use of troops, even if--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 31: Our policy is to back up the United Nations in the trusteeship by every means necessary.
Sentence 32: Q. Mr. President, does that mean that American troops would be used?
Sentence 33: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 34: Not necessarily.
Sentence 35: Q. Mr. President, since you have several times urged conditional immigration into Palestine, do you still favor that?
Sentence 36: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 37: My position hasn't changed with regard to immigration in Palestine.
Sentence 38: Q.
Sentence 39: That might be carried out after the mandate has expired?
Sentence 40: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 41: The first thing to do is to restore peace in the Holy Land, try to see if we can't arrange a settlement that will stop the bloodshed.
Sentence 42: I don't want to see people killed any more.
Sentence 43: We have had enough of it in the past 10 years.
Sentence 44: Q.
Sentence 45: To clarify myself in my own thinking, you have asked Senator Austin to ask the U.N. to call the Jewish and Arab representatives to a truce conference?
Sentence 46: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: That's right.
Sentence 48: That's right.
Sentence 49: That's correct.
Sentence 50: Q. Mr. President, in Mr. Austin's last statement, one of the major factors for the change in partition was the fact that it would have to be imposed by force.
Sentence 51: Do you believe that the trusteeship--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: I don't think that the trusteeship will necessarily have to be enforced by force.
Sentence 53: We could not leave a vacuum on that situation over there, you understand.
Sentence 54: When the British pull out, there is no government.
Sentence 55: These people immediately start killing each other, and there must be some way to keep the peace, and keep utilities and communications and everything like that going, because Palestine is a unit, and unless it is economically bound together it cannot exist.
Sentence 56: Q. Mr. President, is there an alternative step, in case the truce--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 57: We will have to see if we can get the truce before we do anything else.
Sentence 58: That's what we are working on now.
Sentence 59: Q. Mr. President, who would be the trustee?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 60: The United Nations would be the trustee.
Sentence 61: Q. Mr. President, is there any estimate of how long it might be necessary to have a trusteeship?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 62: No.
Sentence 63: That depends altogether on how the matter works out--after the trusteeship gets going.
Sentence 64: Q.
Sentence 65: You are still, sir, in favor of partition at some future date?
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: That is what I am trying to say here as plainly as I can.
Sentence 68: Q. Just to clear up another point, sir, you would draw a distinction between putting in troops to enforce partition and putting in troops to support the trusteeship, is that it, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 69: The United Nations would have to handle that matter.
Sentence 70: We support the United Nations to the limit.
Sentence 71: That doesn't necessarily mean that we would have to put American troops in there.
Sentence 72: Q. Mr. President, in the event that the trusteeship plan is adopted, what would be the status of any free Palestine government erected by the Jewish people?
Sentence 73: They say they are going ahead and set up a government to function beginning May 16th.
Sentence 74: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 75: I am hoping that they will--that the truce will cause a peaceful settlement, and that that will not happen.
Sentence 76: Q. Mr. President, to make it absolutely clear, if the United Nations adopts the trusteeship plan and then decides troops are necessary to enforce it, would troops back that up?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 77: We will cross that bridge when we come to it.
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, considerable criticism seems to go back to United States support of partition in the first place.
Sentence 79: Could not the difficulties have been foreseen at that time?
Sentence 80: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: Did I ever tell you that any schoolboy's hindsight is worth all the President's foresight?
Sentence 82: [Laughter] That is just as true now as it was then.
Sentence 83: Q. Would the United States accept the trusteeship if the United Nations assigned it to them?
Sentence 84: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 85: I don't think the United States would be called upon to accept the trusteeship.
Sentence 86: It will be a United Nations trusteeship, run by the United Nations itself.
Sentence 87: Q. Does that mean another two or three power arrangement?
Sentence 88: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: That matter will have to be worked out in the United Nations.
Sentence 90: I can't give you the details because I am not speaking for the United Nations.
Sentence 91: I am speaking for the United States.
Sentence 92: Q. Mr. President, have your studies of the situation so far suggested that a truce at this time would be a practical possibility?
Sentence 93: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 94: It is a practical possibility, yes.
Sentence 95: Wouldn't be advocating it, if it were not.
Sentence 96: Q. Mr. President, do we have any alternative if the other countries refuse to accept the trusteeship plan?
Sentence 97: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 98: I can't answer that question.
Sentence 99: We will have to wait and see how this works out, because the only other alternative seems to be to slaughter a lot of people.
Sentence 100: That is what I am trying to prevent have been trying to prevent all along.
Sentence 101: Q. Mr. President, is there any truth to the reports appearing in the British press that the United States has asked that Britain continue in Palestine--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 102: Of course, we didn't want Britain to leave Palestine in the present conditions.
Sentence 103: Britain was supposed to stay there until August 15.
Sentence 104: They suddenly took a notion to pull out.
Sentence 105: I don't know why.
Sentence 106: I don't run the British Government, either.
Sentence 107: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, in case the United Nations accepts the trusteeship, would the United States accept a place on that trusteeship?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: We will cross that bridge when we get to it.
Sentence 109: [2.]
Sentence 110: Q. Sir, to change the subject--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: Good!
Sentence 112: [Laughter] Let's hear what the subject is changed to.
Sentence 113: Q.
Sentence 114: There is a lot of commotion on the Hill, principally the Republicans, on exports to Russia.
Sentence 115: Can you say why we continue to export to Russia?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 116: The Commerce Department is handling that situation.
Sentence 117: Most of these things were bought by Russia about 2 years ago or more, and Russia is, at the present time, a friendly nation and has been buying goods from us right along.
Sentence 118: The Commerce Department can give you all the details of what the situation is.
Sentence 119: [3.]
Sentence 120: Q. Mr. President, any comment on the tax bill?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 121: I will comment on the tax bill when it gets to my desk.
Sentence 122: It is going the usual rounds now.
Sentence 123: [4.]
Sentence 124: Q. Mr. President, has the Justice Department or any of your offices under the White House brought to your attention the Ingram case in Georgia--the death sentence of a mother of eight and two of her boys age 15 and 16
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 125: That's the first I've heard of it.
Sentence 126: I don't know anything about it.
Sentence 127: [5.]
Sentence 128: Q. Mr. President, do you favor the Air Force plan for expansion?
Sentence 129: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 130: I am getting up a program for the Congress on defense which I will send down shortly, and I will let you know just exactly how I stand on it.
Sentence 131: Q. Mr. President, do you have any estimate yet on the cost of that program?
Sentence 132: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 133: No.
Sentence 134: The estimate hasn't reached me yet.
Sentence 135: Q. Is it likely to affect the tax reduction situation?
Sentence 136: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 137: I can't answer that.
Sentence 138: [6.]
Sentence 139: Q. Mr. President, has the decision been reached yet as to whether to proclaim or make effective a reciprocal trade agreement with the Czechs?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 140: That matter is being considered by the State Department now.
Sentence 141: You see, that trade agreement covers 15 or 20-maybe 30 nations.
Sentence 142: [7.]
Sentence 143: Q. Mr. President, your speech to Congress was interpreted in the European press as giving a guarantee to the United Nations of the Western European union.
Sentence 144: Is that correct?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: The speech speaks for itself.
Sentence 146: If you read it, it is very clear.
Sentence 147: There were no weasel words in it.
Sentence 148: [8.]
Sentence 149: Q. Mr. President, efforts are being made to revive the Quoddy power project, which I believe you discussed with Congresswoman Smith of Maine?
Sentence 150: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 151: Yes, I did.
Sentence 152: I have always been for it.
Sentence 153: I am still for it.
Sentence 154: [9.]
Sentence 155: Q. Mr. President, do you plan any appeal to the miners to return to work?
Sentence 156: 1
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 157: I am pursuing the legal steps set out in the law in the mine strike now.
Sentence 158: We first had the chief conciliator call in the principals.
Sentence 159: They could not reach an agreement.
Sentence 160: I have appointed the board which the law provides, and when the board makes the report I will take whatever further steps are necessary under the law.
Sentence 161: 1
On March 15, 200,000 coal miners went on strike in support of the United Mine Workers oldage pension demands.
Sentence 162: Q. Do you anticipate, sir, that we will hear before that board--before April 5th?

Sentence 164: That board will report promptly just as soon as it is ready.
Sentence 165: [10.]
Sentence 166: Q. Mr. President, are you likely to ask for daylight saving to conserve fuel in this--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: No, I hadn't thought about it.
Sentence 168: I think daylight saving is a lot of "honey" in most of the places.
Sentence 169: lust upsets the calendar across the country.
Sentence 170: We built those time zones across the country so that the time could be changed in an office so people could use it intelligently.
Sentence 171: In the days gone by there were differences of 15 minutes in cities 10 miles apart.
Sentence 172: We now get an hour's difference in cities that adjoin each other.
Sentence 173: If there is a daylight saving program, it should be a national program, not a local one.
Sentence 174: I would be in favor of a national one.
Sentence 175: [11.]

Sentence 195: [12.]
Sentence 196: Q. Was the Star editorial correct in saying that you would rather be right than President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 197: Well, you Would have to draw your own conclusions.
Sentence 198: That was a cartoon, not an editorial.
Sentence 199: 1
[Laughter] I have the original of that cartoon, that's how much I think of it.
Sentence 200: 1
The editorial entitled "He'd Rather Be Right--" appeared in the Washington Evening Star of March 24, 1948.
Sentence 201: On March 14 there had appeared in the same paper a cartoon by Jim Berryman.

Sentence 211: I can't go.
Sentence 212: I'm sorry.
Sentence 213: Q. Can't go.
Sentence 214: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 215: No.
Sentence 216: I have to stay here at this desk with the job.
Sentence 217: [14.]

Sentence 220: No, I have not.
Sentence 221: [15] Q. Mr. President, there is talk of a new military program involving additional billions of dollars.
Sentence 222: Could you comment on that?
Sentence 223: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 224: I will give you the answer to that as soon as it is ready.
Sentence 225: I don't want to comment on it because it isn't ready yet, and nobody knows anything about what I am going to recommend.
Sentence 226: I will let you know as soon as I am ready to make a recommendation.
Sentence 227: Reporter:
Sentence 228: Thank you, Mr. President.
