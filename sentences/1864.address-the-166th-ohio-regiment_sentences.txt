Sentence 1: 1864 Address The 166Th Ohio Regiment

SOLDIERS--I suppose you are going home to see your families and friends.
Sentence 2: For the services you have done in this great struggle in which we are engaged, I present you sincere thanks for myself and the country.
Sentence 3: I almost always feel inclined, when I say anything to soldiers, to impress upon them, in a few brief remarks, the importance of success in this contest.
Sentence 4: It is not merely for the day, but for all time to come, that we should perpetuate for our children's children that great and free government which we have enjoyed all our lives.
Sentence 5: I beg you to remember this, not merely for my sake, but for yours.
Sentence 6: I happen, temporarily, to occupy this big White House.
Sentence 7: I am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father's child has.
Sentence 8: It is in order that each one of you may have, through this free government which we have enjoyed, an open field, and a fair chance for your industry, enterprise, and intelligence; that you may all have equal privileges in the race of life with all its desirable human aspirations--it is for this that the struggle should be maintained, that we may not lose our birthrights--not only for one, but for two or three years, if necessary.
Sentence 9: The nation is worth fighting for, to secure such an inestimable jewel.
