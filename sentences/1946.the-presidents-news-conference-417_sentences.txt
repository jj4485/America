THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have no particular statement to make to you today.
Sentence 3: I thought you might want to ask questions.
Sentence 4: [1.]
Sentence 5: Q. Mr. President, are there any negotiations now in progress with other countries for bases overseas--for our bases overseas?
Sentence 6: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 7: None that I know of.
Sentence 8: [2.]
Sentence 9: Q. Mr. President, were you speaking in a Pickwickian sense when you asked Mr. Ickes to tell the truth about Mr. Pauley?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 10: I never speak in a Pickwickian sense.
Sentence 11: Q. Would you regard it, sir--would you regard Mr. Ickes's statement as an attempt to impugn your integrity?
Sentence 12: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 13: Well, I don't think he would dare do that.
Sentence 14: Q. Will you withdraw Mr. Pauley's nomination, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 15: I will not.
Sentence 16: Q.
Sentence 17: Do you expect Mr. Pauley may ask that it be withdrawn?

Sentence 24: Yes, I did.
Sentence 25: Q.
Sentence 26: Do you expect Mr. Pauley to be confirmed, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 27: Yes, I do.
Sentence 28: Mr. Pauley is a good man.
Sentence 29: He made the best deal, I think, that has ever been made on a reparations program as an American representative on the Reparations Commission, both in Germany and in Japan; and the policy that he set is now being followed in Italy.
Sentence 30: Q.
Sentence 31: What is the deal on Japan?
Sentence 32: I don't think that has ever been made public.
Sentence 33: Could you tell us about it ?
Sentence 34: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 35: No, I can't.
Sentence 36: It is not entirely complete as yet.
Sentence 37: Q. Mr. President, how did you happen to announce Mr. Pauley for your man--how did it happen you picked out that particular job for him?
Sentence 38: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 40: [3.]
Sentence 41: Q. Mr. President, when you sent General Marshall out to China, you gave him certain instructions, which you made public, on our objectives and our policies in China.

Sentence 45: Do you plan on doing the--doing the same thing with General Smith when you send him to Moscow?
Sentence 46: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 48: It is an entirely different situation.
Sentence 49: Q.
Sentence 50: Yes, they are.
Sentence 51: [Laughter]
Sentence 52: [4.]
Sentence 53: Q. Mr. President, despite what was in Secretary Ickes's letter, there is still some confusion as to whether he ever did protest the idea of the Pauley appointment.
Sentence 54: There have been reports that he was asked that, and he did say he thought it was a bad one.
Sentence 55: Can you clear that up?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 56: The only conversations I ever had with Mr. Ickes on Mr. Pauley, he complimented Mr. Pauley very highly as a good public servant.
Sentence 57: Q. Since the nomination went up?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: No, One time--not so long ago-July of last year, when Mr. Ickes was desiring to quit, if you remember, and I persuaded him to stay.
Sentence 59: Q. Something was said about Pauley--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 60: Mr. Pauley had been one of his advisers in the Petroleum Administration for War, and he thought highly of him.
Sentence 61: Q. Mr. President, in connection with that, in Mr. Ickes's statement you recall he said that the last time he saw you that the matter did come up, that he showed you Mr. Walsh's telegram, and then his closing line on that--sort of sally--was that the President said--that isn't close--tell the truth but go gentle on it.
Sentence 62: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: I never saw Mr. Walsh's telegram.
Sentence 64: It was never shown to me in the Cabinet room, or on Friday after the Cabinet meeting.
Sentence 65: Mr. Ickes came and said that he had been summoned to testify on Mr. Pauley, and I said, "Well, tell the truth, and be kind to Pauley."
Sentence 66: Q. Mr. President, were you familiar with the written memoranda that Mr. Ickes gave to the committee, when you said you thought Ickes might be mistaken?
Sentence 67: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 68: No, I wasn't.
Sentence 69: I don't keep written memoranda for future use, and I didn't know that any of my Cabinet officers did, either.
Sentence 70: Q. Mr. Ickes presented a series of written memoranda and made the--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 71: I knew nothing about them, of course.
Sentence 72: Q. Mr. President, may we have that sentence of yours repeated--Mr. Ickes said something after the Cabinet meeting?
Sentence 73: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: He said he had been summoned to appear before the committee, on Mr. Pauley, and I stated to him, "Well, tell the truth, but be kind to Pauley."
Sentence 75: Q. Did you tell him to be "as gentle," or "as kind"?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: I said, "be kind."
Sentence 77: Q. Do you recall when the Secretary of the Navy first recommended Mr. Pauley's appointment to that--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: Back in November--a long time before Mr. Bard quit.
Sentence 79: I think it was back in November--maybe in October.
Sentence 80: Q. October, 1945
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: Yes--of last year.
Sentence 82: Q. Would you like to elaborate--
Q. Initiated by the Secretary of the Navy, sir?
Sentence 83: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: Yes.
Sentence 85: Q. Could you elaborate on that, Mr. President, that President Roosevelt ha&--having had the intention to appoint him?
Sentence 86: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: That is what the Secretary of the Navy informed me.
Sentence 88: I had not talked to Mr. Roosevelt about it before he died.
Sentence 89: Q. Well, Mr. President, since the testimony of Mr. Pauley and Mr. Ickes differs on a single fact, do you have any choice as to which of them was telling the truth?
Sentence 90: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: Are you going to try to insist that I call somebody a liar at a press conference?
Sentence 92: [More laughter]
Q.
Sentence 93: [Aside] Yes!
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 94: My suggestion to you would be to wait until all the evidence is in, and then draw your own conclusions.
Sentence 95: Q. Do you think, sir, that the Justice Department ought to investigate to see which one is telling the truth ?
Sentence 96: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: I don't see any reason for that.
Sentence 98: This is a political argument.
Sentence 99: [5.]
Sentence 100: Q. Speaking of politics, sir, have you told your friends that you do not want to run for the nomination in 1948?.[Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: The first time I ever heard of that was what I saw--as Will Rogers used to say--what I saw that Mr. Reynolds had discussed in the paper.
Sentence 102: He hadn't discussed that matter with me, and Mr. Hannegan says he hasn't discussed the matter with him.
Sentence 103: I never heard of the conversation before.
Sentence 104: Q.
Sentence 105: In that connection, sir, do you want to run in 1948?
Sentence 106: [Much laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: Don't you think that you are being a little previous on that?
Sentence 108: When 1948 comes along, I will have to make a decision, which I will make.
Sentence 109: I am not thinking of 1948 now.
Sentence 110: I am trying to get through 1946.
Sentence 111: [More laughter]
Sentence 112: [6.]
Sentence 113: Q. Mr. President, when might we expect an announcement concerning Mr. Ickes's successor in the Cabinet?

Sentence 115: I am not in any hurry about it.
Sentence 116: [7.]
Sentence 117: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us how you and the experts arrive at net worth in determining the basis for a fair return in the industry under the Executive order?
Sentence 118: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 119: I don't attempt to arrive at it.
Sentence 120: That is not my job.
Sentence 121: That is what I have the experts for, and I don't bother my head with it.
Sentence 122: I have too many other things to think about.
