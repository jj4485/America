"In fairness to all concerned, I do not intend to make any hasty predictions on the amount of so-called 'savings' effected by the Congress in the 1948 budget until all the facts are in.
Sentence 21: "A great many complex factors have to be taken into consideration before a complete, accurate, and understandable report can be made.
Sentence 22: In some cases, Congress has substituted contract authority for direct appropriations; in others, appropriations originally requested for the fiscal year 1947 were not enacted until 1948 and so must be considered as part of this fiscal year.
Sentence 23: "In addition, Congress has provided funds for certain agencies, such as the Post Office and the National Labor Relations Board, on a 'part year' basis and instructed agencies to request deficiencies, if necessary, to complete the fiscal year.
Sentence 24: "Among the other facts to be determined is the actual effect of rescissions upon expenditures during this fiscal year, since a large part of the rescissions made by Congress were in funds which would not have been spent anyway.
Sentence 25: "What is most important, however, is the fact that none of the predictions I have seen have properly related congressional changes in appropriations to estimated expenditures for 1948.
Sentence 26: In the last analysis, the American people are more interested in how much their Government will actually spend during this fiscal year than they are in shifts and changes in the appropriation structure.
Sentence 27: "For these reasons, I have ordered a detailed and exhaustive study of all the facts.
Sentence 28: When this is completed, I shall issue a review and analysis, supported by detailed tables and summaries, which will bring up to date revised estimates of receipts and expenditures for this fiscal year.
Sentence 29: "
And I will have no further comment to make on the budget until I have all the facts before me so I can understand them, and so you can understand them.
