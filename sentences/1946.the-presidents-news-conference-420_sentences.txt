Sentence 1: 1946 The Presidents News Conference 420

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I am sending down the name of William J. Kennedy of Cleveland, Ohio, to be the Chairman of the Railroad Retirement Board--the one that Murray Latimer left.
Sentence 4: [2.]
Sentence 5: I want to call your attention this morning to Mr. Snyder's sixth report on reconversion.
Sentence 6: I have read the report twice, and it is a most interesting report.
Sentence 7: Shows that production of goods and services for the civilian market is higher today than ever before in the Nation's history, in war or in peace, and is still going up.
Sentence 8: And it goes into detail on the--the equipment after V-J Day; and the wage-price policy is being translated into action without losing vital ground to inflation.
Sentence 9: We must not be complacent about these good signs of progress, however.
Sentence 10: I have got a mimeographed release here,
1
which I would like for all of you to read carefully; and then it wouldn't hurt any of you to spend your time reading that report.
Sentence 11: That is the best answer to the rumors and things that have been made about the wage price policy and the reconversion policy which has been pursued by the administration since V-J Day.
Sentence 12: I think it's the best answer that you can possibly have on the subject.
Sentence 13: It covers the whole front--take you a little while to read through.
Sentence 14: I read it in half an hour, and I read it again in another half an hour.
Sentence 15: It's worth reading.
Sentence 16: Anybody have any questions?
See Item 73.
Sentence 17: Q.
Sentence 18: I would like to ask, Mr. President-I read that, not as carefully as you did--I was impressed with that general statement of the large number of goods, but it is perfectly true that the goods are not well distributed at present.
Sentence 19: We have no shirts, and things of that sort.
Sentence 20: Would you, Mr. Snyder, or the President, have anything to say about that particular--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 21: Well, there are certain individual things--shirts, for instance, that you mention, that distribution has not been as--the distribution has not been as good as it should have been--and a great many other things, but you must understand that all shelves--all inventories were down.
Sentence 22: Q. Yes.
Sentence 23: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 24: And I had one startling thing told to me just this morning: that it takes 32,000 automobiles for each dealer to put one in his window that doesn't, that is not for sale.
Sentence 25: It takes 32,000 automobiles to put one in each dealer's window for show purposes.
Sentence 26: Mr. Snyder: Mr. President, on those textile things, the CPA and the OPA will issue some regulations within the next week that are going to further supply the low end of textile articles.
Sentence 27: CPA is directing certain yardage into the low end products, and OPA is making--has made, in the last 10 days, some additional adjustments in pricing, which will certainly build that up--
Q. That has to do with shirts, doesn't it?
Sentence 28: Mr. Snyder: Well, textiles--
Q. And others?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 29: Textiles and other things.
Sentence 30: Mr. Snyder: Men's and boys' clothing.
Sentence 31: Q.
Sentence 32: How long will it be before they are evenly distributed?
Sentence 33: When can we get a shirt?
Sentence 34: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 35: Your guess is as good as mine.
Sentence 36: I have got some surplus shirts, if you don't wear them too big.
Sentence 37: Q. 15 1/2; 35!
Sentence 38: [More laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 39: I have some 15 1/2, but it's 33.
Sentence 40: [More laughter]
Q.
Sentence 41: [Aside] No shirt!
Sentence 42: Q. Mr. Snyder know whether or not the new regulations will now permit a man to buy a suit with two pairs of pants?
Sentence 43: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: I can't answer that.
Sentence 45: I suppose it's--as soon as they get enough woolens and things of that sort, you will be able to buy two pairs of pants, as you formerly could before the war.
Sentence 46: Mr. Snyder: Up to now two pants are not in.
Sentence 47: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 48: Mr. Snyder says up to now the two pants are not in yet.
Sentence 49: [3.]
Sentence 50: Q. Mr. President, the Committee for Economic Development, which is a pretty well-recognized outfit--nongovernmental--research outfit--in its last report contended that production alone could never cure inflationary trends, and that what was needed was more fiscal control, and particularly restrictions on bank credits.
Sentence 51: I think the report doesn't mention the need for that, and I wondered if it had been considered?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: Yes, it has been considered.
Sentence 53: And it is being considered.
Sentence 54: All those things have a hand in the control of inflation.
Sentence 55: We are doing everything we possibly can to prevent inflation.
Sentence 56: That is our biggest problem at the present time.
Sentence 57: Q. Mr. President, do I understand you correctly that we will--the Government is considering new fiscal restrictions, such as restrictions on bank credits?
Sentence 58: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 59: I didn't say that the Government was considering, I said we had been doing that.
Sentence 60: And the Secretary of the Treasury has been working on a fiscal policy of the country right straight along.
Sentence 61: There is no immediate change contemplated right now.
Sentence 62: [4.]
Sentence 63: Q. Could you or Mr. Snyder tell us what a prolonged coal strike would do to this report's predictions?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: A prolonged coal strike?
Sentence 65: I can answer that categorically.
Sentence 66: It would knock the whole thing out.
Sentence 67: The steel strike cost us about seven million tons of steel production that go to make rails and rods, and things of that sort.
Sentence 68: That is about one-ninth of the yearly production.
Sentence 69: Q.
Sentence 70: How many tons was that--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 71: Seven million.
Sentence 72: Q.--seven hundred million?
Sentence 73: Q.
Sentence 74: You said about one-ninth of a year's production?
Sentence 75: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: That is rails and rods, and things of that sort.
Sentence 77: That is not pig iron.
Sentence 78: That would be eleven million tons with pig iron.
Sentence 79: [5.]
Sentence 80: Q. Can you say anything about a balanced budget, on the strength of this.--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: Not at this time.
Sentence 82: I will talk to you about that a little later.
Sentence 83: [6.]
Sentence 84: Q. Mr. President, can you say anything about the coal strike in general, the possibility of the mediator--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 85: Well, the Labor Department has a mediator with the operators and with Mr. Lewis, and they are working diligently trying to arrive at a settlement.
Sentence 86: [7.]
Sentence 87: Q. Mr. President, the report says that the deficit for this fiscal year would be reduced by several billions.
Sentence 88: Have you any figure in mind as to what the deficit will be June 30th?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: I will give you a statement on that at the next press conference, and go into detail with you.
Sentence 90: It is not quite ready yet, and I don't want to put out any guesses.
Sentence 91: [8.]
Sentence 92: Q. Mr. President, will this Russell amendment have very much effect on this report?
Sentence 93: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 94: I am not familiar with the Russell--you mean--
Q. Case amendment.
Sentence 95: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: The Case-Russell--that will upset the applecart if it goes through.
Sentence 97: I have said that to the Congress.
Sentence 98: [9.]
Sentence 99: Q. May I ask a question about this fiscal business?
Sentence 100: There's a drive on by which such banks as the Morris Plan--these banks that lend you a thousand dollars for more consumer credit, is that a part of the fiscal control that you are speaking of?
Sentence 101: Is that a detail that--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 102: I can't answer that.
Sentence 103: I am not familiar with it at all.
Sentence 104: I am not familiar with that at all.

Sentence 113: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 114: I think--I think that there has been a great deal of comment on that.
Sentence 115: I read an article in the Baltimore Sun this morning that seemed to me to be a very good article on the subject.
Sentence 116: It's on the editorial page of the Baltimore Sun.
Sentence 117: [12.]
Sentence 118: Q. Mr. President, whatever Ambassador you appoint to Argentina, will it justify these suggestions that are being made now, that it will represent a softening of United States policy towards Argentina?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 119: I can't answer that now.
Sentence 120: [13.]
Sentence 121: Q. Mr. President, has your new horseshoe court been staked out as yet?

Sentence 135: That is a matter for the government of the District of Columbia.
Sentence 136: [16.]
Sentence 137: Q. Mr. President, to get back to the shirts, the principal cry of the retailers is on the OPA adjustment of the maximum price policy, which they said is causing them to withhold $3 shirts, because they couldn't get $2 shirts to match up.
Sentence 138: Have you any comment on that?
Sentence 139: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 140: No.
Sentence 141: I haven't any comment to make on it because I haven't gone into the details.

Sentence 158: My family didn't.
Sentence 159: Q. Rayons?
Sentence 160: Oh, plenty of rayons.
