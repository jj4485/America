Sentence 1: 1930 The Presidents News Conference 794

LONDON NAVAL TREATY
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have one question this morning that I can reply to, but in the nature of things it must be background matter.
Sentence 3: It is as to whether I would care to say whether the ratification of the London treaty is a partisan matter or not.
Sentence 4: It certainly is not--broad foreign policies of the Nation and not partisan policies.
Sentence 5: When our delegation went to London they went as Americans and not as members of a political party, and there is no partisanship whatever in this treaty.
Sentence 6: That is all I have got.
