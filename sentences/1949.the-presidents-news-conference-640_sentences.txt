Sentence 176: [15.]
Sentence 177: Q. Mr. President, assuming that there is a steel strike in the big three or the big four steel companies, and the others operate through some sort of modus vivendi, would you consider that a national emergency under the Taft-Hartley Act?

Sentence 183: Q.
Sentence 184: Well, I have in mind statements that Senator Taft has made repeatedly, that he thought there was only one real national emergency under the Taft-Hartley Act, in the sense that the authors of that understood national emergency, and that was the first coal strike?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 188: Yes, but there were several others where national emergency action was taken, and Senator Taft has indicated that he did not--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 189: What were the others?
Sentence 190: I don't remember the others, except the railroad strike, and when there is a strike in the railroads, it is an emergency the next day, you all know that.
Sentence 191: Q. Four maritime strikes, one on meat packing, one in communications--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 192: Well, it took sometime for the emergency to develop, and when the emergency comes about and it is the belief of the President that there is a national emergency, he usually declares it under the law.
Sentence 193: That's the rule I have been following.
Sentence 194: I don't care what his point was.
Sentence 195: [16.]

Sentence 209: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 210: I have not anything of the kind in contemplation at this moment.
Sentence 211: Q. Is that in the form of an Executive order, Mr. President, regarding unification?
Sentence 212: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 213: It is the same sort of reorganization plan as any other reorganization plan would be, worked in exactly the same way.
Sentence 214: It will be in the form of an Executive order and will be sent to the Congress; and if it stays in for 60 days and is not voted down, it will be the law.
Sentence 215: Q.
Sentence 216: That is the armed services unification--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 217: Yes, that's right.

Q. No, it isn't as yet.
Sentence 225: THE PRESIDENT.--and I can't do anything about it.

Sentence 229: [20.]

Sentence 233: 11

On July 20, 1949, the President signed H.R. 858, "A bill to clarify the overtime compensation provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended" (Public Law 177, 63 Stat. 446).
Sentence 234: [21.]
Sentence 235: Q. Mr. President, are you satisfied with the conduct of the Hiss trial by Judge Kaufman?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 236: I think that Judge Kaufman is a good judge.
Sentence 237: I appointed him to the bench, and I think he has acted all right.

Sentence 248: Period.
Sentence 249: Q.
Sentence 250: What was that figure?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 251: Fifty million for Franco.
Sentence 252: Q. Does that mean you would veto the ECA appropriation?

Sentence 257: Q. Would you say why, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 258: Because we are not on friendly relations with Spain at the present time, and there is a certain way in which that situation can be developed.
Sentence 259: If the other European countries vote to take Spain in, and they can convince us that Spain is to come in, that's a different matter.
