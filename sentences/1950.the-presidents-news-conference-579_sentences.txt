Sentence 1: 1950 The Presidents News Conference 579

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: Be seated, please.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: I have a statement here that I want to read to you.
Sentence 5: Mr. Ross tells me that you have asked him several questions about Chinese Communist intervention in Korea.
Sentence 6: 1
I thought I would set it out here so that you would understand it.
Sentence 7: I hope you can understand it.
Sentence 8: And copies, of course, will be available for you when the conference is over.
Sentence 9: 1
On November 3, 1950, Chinese Communist armies began to move into North Korea from Manchuria.
Sentence 10: See also Item 295 [1].
Sentence 11: [Reading] "The Security Council has before it a resolution concerning the grave situation caused by the Chinese Communist intervention in Korea.
Sentence 12: This resolution, introduced by the representatives of Cuba, Ecuador, France, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States, reaffirms that it is the policy of the United Nations to hold the Chinese frontier inviolate, to protect fully legitimate Korean and Chinese interests in the frontier zone, and to withdraw the United Nations forces from Korea as soon as stability has been restored and a unified, independent, and democratic government established throughout Korea.
Sentence 13: "This resolution further calls upon all states and authorities to withdraw immediately from Korea all individuals or units which are assisting the North Korean forces.
Sentence 14: I am sure that all members of the Security Council genuinely interested in restoring peace in the Far East will not only support this resolution but also use their influence to obtain compliance with it.
Sentence 15: "The United Nations forces now are being attacked from the safety of a privileged sanctuary.
Sentence 16: Planes operating from bases in China cross over into Korea to attack United Nations ground and air forces, and then flee back across the border.
Sentence 17: The Chinese Communist and North Korean Communist forces are being reinforced, supplied, and equipped from bases behind the safety of the Sino-Korean border.
Sentence 18: "The pretext which the Chinese Communists advance for taking offensive action against United Nations forces in Korea from behind the protection afforded by the Sino-Korean border is their professed belief that these forces intend to carry hostilities across the frontier into Chinese territory.
Sentence 19: "The resolutions and every other action taken by the United Nations demonstrates beyond any doubt that no such intention has ever been entertained.
Sentence 20: On the contrary, it has been repeatedly stated that it is the intention of the United Nations to localize the conflict and to withdraw its forces from Korea as soon as the situation permits.
Sentence 21: Speaking for the United States Government and people, I can give assurance that we support and are acting within the limits of United Nations policy in Korea, and that we have never at any time entertained any intention to carry hostilities into China.
Sentence 22: So far as the United States is concerned, I wish to state unequivocally that because of our deep devotion to the cause of world peace and our long-standing friendship for the people of China we will take every honorable step to prevent any extension of the hostilities in the Far East.
Sentence 23: If the Chinese Communist authorities or people believe otherwise, it can only be because they are being deceived by those whose advantage it is to prolong and extend hostilities in the Far East against the interests of all Far Eastern people.
Sentence 24: "Let it be understood, however, that the desire for peace, in order to be effective, must be shared by all concerned.
Sentence 25: If the Chinese Communists share the desire of the United Nations for peace and security in the Far East, they will not take upon themselves the responsibility for obstructing the objectives of the United Nations in Korea.
Sentence 26: "
That will be available for you in mimeographed form when you go out.
Sentence 27: Q. Mr. President, in that connection, the Red Chinese admitted yesterday in a document presented to the United Nations that they had intervened in Korea.
Sentence 28: I think it was the first such admission.
Sentence 29: Would you comment on that, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 30: I have no comment on it.
Sentence 31: I saw that admission, but I do not want to comment on it now.
Sentence 32: Q.
Sentence 33: Do you think there is any significance, sir, in the fact that that document was delivered by Malik, the Russian delegate?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 34: Well, you can draw your own conclusions from that.
Sentence 35: [2.]
Sentence 36: Q. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I believe, you said it would be a long, long time before you appointed an ambassador to Spain?
Sentence 37: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: That's right.
Sentence 39: Q.
Sentence 40: I was wondering if this new loan might mean that you have changed your mind on that?
Sentence 41: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 42: The position on the Spanish loan has never changed.
Sentence 43: I have said here time and again that whenever Spain made the proper show to the Export-Import Bank, I supposed that the loan would be made.
Sentence 44: That doesn't have anything to do with appointing an ambassador to Spain.
Sentence 45: Q.
Sentence 46: You still maintain that--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: I feel rather reluctant about appointing an ambassador to Spain.
Sentence 48: I could be convinced that it is necessary, but I am not in that frame of mind now.
Sentence 49: [3.]
Sentence 50: Q. Mr. President, would you say a few words about Carter Barton?
Sentence 51: I understand he--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: About what?
Q. Carter Barron--chairman of the Sesquicentennial Commission here.
Sentence 53: Mr. Ross: He died today.
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: Oh, I didn't know about it.
Sentence 56: That is news to me.
Sentence 57: I am very sorry to hear it.
Sentence 58: Carter was one of the ablest fellows around town, and one of the greatest assets that the District had.
Sentence 59: I didn't know about it.
Sentence 60: [4.]
Sentence 61: Q. Mr. President, does your statement on Korea rule out consideration of the creation of a buffer zone in the Chinese-North Korean--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 62: The statement speaks for itself.
Sentence 63: You read it carefully, and I think you will find out just exactly what it means.
Sentence 64: [5.]
Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, are you going to try to make an effort to get along with the Southern bloc in the Senate?
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: I have always gotten along with the Southern bloc in the Senate.
Sentence 68: It's never been I that has never been able to get along.
Sentence 69: [Laughter]
Sentence 70: [6.]
Sentence 71: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us about your talks today with the Secretary of State and Mr. Dulles
2
on the Japanese peace treaty?
Sentence 72: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 73: I had Mr. Dulles in with Mr. Acheson for a report on the progress that he has made in the discussions for the Japanese peace treaty.
Sentence 74: He reported to me that he had been in conference with all the nations interested, that the matter had now been referred to the various governments, and that in 2 or 3 weeks he expected to have further conversations on the same subject, as to how the governments felt on our--the proposals.
Sentence 75: Not our proposals, but the proposals that had been made for the Japanese treaty.
Sentence 76: 2
John Foster Dulles, Consultant to the Secretary of State.
Sentence 77: [7.]
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, this is the first press conference since the election--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: [laughing].
Sentence 80: I have been waiting for that one.
Sentence 81: Q.
Sentence 82: As I remember it, you made some right hopeful predictions--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 83: Yes, indeed.
Sentence 84: And, like all the rest of the pollsters and predictors, it did not come out exactly as I thought it would.
Sentence 85: But I am used to that.
Sentence 86: And you want to bear in mind that this is an off year election and it is the smallest loss for the party in power since 1916, with the exception of 1934, so I don't think there is anything to be very blue about.
Sentence 87: At least, I'm not blue.
Sentence 88: Q. Mr. President, aren't you blue about Mr. Taft?
3
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: No, I'm not.
Sentence 90: Mr. Taft won legitimately by a big majority, and he had a perfect right to do that.
Sentence 91: I never went outside of my State to do any fighting.
Sentence 92: I fought for the Senator in my State, and I got him.
Sentence 93: 4
[Laughter]
3
Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio.
Sentence 94: 4
Thomas C. Hennings, Jr., Senator-elect from Missouri.
Sentence 95: [8.]
Sentence 96: Q. Mr. President, Paul Fitzpatrick
5
just told us that in his opinion you would be the Democratic candidate in 1952.
Sentence 97: May I ask, sir, whether you would accept the nomination ?
Sentence 98: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 99: I am not ready to comment on that subject.
Sentence 100: 5
Paul Fitzpatrick, Chairman, New York Democratic State Committee.
Sentence 101: Q.
Sentence 102: Any other comment, Mr. President, about Mr. Fitzpatrick's talk with you this afternoon?
Sentence 103: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: He was in to report to me the situation in New York, and explained to me how it came about; and I was glad to hear about it.
Sentence 105: [9.]
Sentence 106: Q. Mr. President, was it 1934 you said this was the smallest loss--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: Smallest loss since 1916, except 1934--that's right--the Democrats gained 7 seats.
Sentence 108: [10.]
Sentence 109: Q. Mr. President, some of the Republicans have been interpreting the election as meaning that you should ask for Mr. Acheson's resignation?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 110: Mr. Acheson is going to remain Secretary of State, and you might just as well quit speculating about it.
Sentence 111: He is going to be Secretary of State, period.
Sentence 112: [11.]
Sentence 113: Q. Mr. President, do you think that the results might indicate that the country might want to go slow on some parts of your domestic program?
Sentence 114: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 115: No, I do not.
Sentence 116: Most of these results were due to local conditions.
Sentence 117: I would like to analyze every one of them for you, but it would take a little too much time.
Sentence 118: [12.]
Sentence 119: Q. Mr. President, have you any preference for Senate majority leadership?
Sentence 120: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 121: No.
Sentence 122: That is a matter for the Senate itself to decide.
Sentence 123: [13.]
Sentence 124: Q. Mr. President, has the possibility of President-elect Vargas of Brazil to come up on an official visit yet come to your attention?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 125: No, it has not.
Sentence 126: Somebody over here wanted to
[14.]
Sentence 127: Q. Mr. President, do you regard the New York State political results as a local situation?
Sentence 128: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 129: Yes, entirely.
Sentence 130: I am very happy that the Senator was elected,
6
and that we only came out with a net loss of one Congressman.
Sentence 131: 6
Senator Herbert H. Lehman of New York.
Sentence 132: [15.]
Sentence 133: Q. Mr. President, I would love to have you analyze Mr. Taft's victory.
Sentence 134: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 135: Well now, I will let you do that.
Sentence 136: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 137: But you said you would.
Sentence 138: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 139: I could--I could--I can analyze it for you.
Sentence 140: Q.
Sentence 141: The question was, you weren't unhappy about it ?
Sentence 142: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 143: Any State can elect anybody they want to the Senate.
Sentence 144: And I have known Senator Taft ever since he has been in the Senate, and he and I never had any personal falling out of any kind.
Sentence 145: We just don't agree on public policy, and that is the way a democracy ought to run.
Sentence 146: [16.]
Sentence 147: Q. Mr. President, are you going to call Congress in session earlier than the 27th?
Sentence 148: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 149: No, I am not.
Sentence 150: The reason for that is that I was making a survey of the situation, and it was not intended for publication.
Sentence 151: It leaked, unfortunately, and you gentlemen began to speculate about this, that, and the other thing.
Sentence 152: The objective was to find out just what was necessary to be done, and whether it could be done completely in a short session.
Sentence 153: The principal thing that we had to consider was appropriations and a tax bill, and the consummation of the Hawaii and Alaska statehood, and rent control.
Sentence 154: I found that the appropriations could not be in shape to present to the Congress before the 27th, due to conditions over which nobody had any control, and that the tax matter has already been presented to the Ways and Means Committee of the House, and they are working on it.
Sentence 155: Therefore, there wasn't any use in calling the Congress back sooner, because the House has no business to transact.
Sentence 156: All these matters I have referred to, except the appropriations and the tax bill, are in the Senate.
Sentence 157: Q.
Sentence 158: What appropriation is that--military supplemental.--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 159: Military--deficiency appropriations to meet the Korean conflict.
Sentence 160: [17.]
Sentence 161: Q. Mr. President, on that question of interpreting the election as a sign to go slow, is there an implication there that you will continue to press for your Fair Deal program?
Sentence 162: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 163: Most certainly.
Sentence 164: I will continue to press for it as long as I am President.
Sentence 165: I have been pressing for it since the 6th day of September 1945.
Sentence 166: 7

See 1945 volume, this series, Item 128.
Sentence 167: [18.]
Sentence 168: Q. Mr. President, is there any investigation to be made of the fact that the boys in Korea are not getting sufficient clothing?
Sentence 169: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 170: I am informed by General MacArthur that they are, and that is just-well, I won't say what it is--but if General MacArthur says they have plenty of clothing, that is all the authority that I need to go on.
Sentence 171: [19.]
Sentence 172: Q. Mr. President, Senator Taft, at a press conference 2 days ago, said that high taxes could lead to inflation if they were passed on in higher wage requests and higher prices to the consumer, and suggested the idea that he thought wage and price controls would probably be necessary now to prevent that?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 173: Mr. Taft has got a right to his own opinion.
Sentence 174: I just don't agree with him.
Sentence 175: [20.]
Sentence 176: Q. Mr. President, the Export-Import Bank Monday signed an agreement with a group of Argentine bankers for a credit of $125 million.
Sentence 177: Do you wish to comment ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 178: No.
Sentence 179: That is the business of the Export-Import Bank, and if it is a good loan it's all right; and I judge it is, or they wouldn't have made it.
Sentence 180: [21.]
Sentence 181: Q. Mr. President, will you present your whole New Deal program to the November 27th session, or will you--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: No.
Sentence 183: It has been presented to the Congress in words of one syllable time and again.
Sentence 184: It will be presented to the January session of the new Congress.
Sentence 185: Q.
Sentence 186: It will be presented then?
Sentence 187: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 188: This Congress will be informed on various subjects by letter or otherwise on things that are to be done.
Sentence 189: I have already written a letter on the tax bill.
Sentence 190: I shall write a letter on the appropriations.
Sentence 191: I shall ask them to finish up with the Hawaiian and Alaskan statehood bills.
Sentence 192: I shall ask them to extend the rent control, and then whatever else is necessary will be presented to them in that form.
Sentence 193: Q.
Sentence 194: What do you expect to get, rather than hope?
Sentence 195: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 196: I hope to get it all.
Sentence 197: Q. No, expect.
Sentence 198: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 199: I expect to get it all done, if you want to put it that way.
Sentence 200: I wouldn't be trying to get it if I didn't expect to get it.
Sentence 201: I hope to get everything I ask for.
Sentence 202: [22.]
Sentence 203: Q. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about a price increase in steel.
Sentence 204: Do you have any comment?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 205: I know nothing about it.
Sentence 206: That is the first I've heard of it.
Sentence 207: [23.]
Sentence 208: Q. Mr. President, will that program include repeal of the Taft-Hartley law, sir, or something less?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 209: It is already before the Congress.
Sentence 210: That is a matter that is already before the Congress, and I don't know whether it is necessary to reiterate it or not.
Sentence 211: If they think it is necessary, I will.
Sentence 212: Q.
Sentence 213: In your St. Louis speech
8
you said something about removing the restrictive provisions--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 214: That's right--that's right.
Sentence 215: 8
See Item 279.
Sentence 216: Q.
Sentence 217: You would be satisfied with some amendments then, sir?
Sentence 218: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 219: I can't tell you until they come before me.
Sentence 220: Q.
Sentence 221: You are speaking now in terms of the January session rather than--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 222: Yes.
Sentence 223: Q.
Sentence 224: I just wanted to know that.
Sentence 225: [24.]
Sentence 226: Q. Mr. President, there have been protests to the Secretary of State recently from Mr. Murray of the CIO and Mr. Green of the A.F. of L.
9
and similar farm leaders who have charged that the State Department is trying to make the Food and Agriculture Organization into a factfinding research organization.
Sentence 227: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 228: I don't know anything about it, and I have got no comment on it.
Sentence 229: Whenever anybody's toes are tread on, you can always hear them yell for these restrictions to be put on the other fellow, not on themselves.
Sentence 230: 9
Philip Murray, president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor.
Sentence 231: [25.]
Sentence 232: Q. Do you feel that wage and price controls are not necessary now?
Sentence 233: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 234: I can't tell you that.
Sentence 235: I have never said they are not necessary.
Sentence 236: The survey is a continuing one, and when the time comes for price and wage controls, they will be put on.
Sentence 237: I don't think the time is here right now.
Sentence 238: [26.]
Sentence 239: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us anything about how soon we might have a name for the price stabilizer?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 240: Just as soon as I can find a man with the guts to take the job, I will announce him to you.
Sentence 241: 10
Reporter:
Sentence 242: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 243: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 244: You are entirely welcome.
Sentence 245: 10
On December 6, 1950, Michael V. DiSalle was confirmed by the Senate as Director of Price Stabilization.
