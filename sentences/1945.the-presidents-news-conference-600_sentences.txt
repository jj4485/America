Sentence 1: 1945
Sentence 2: The Presidents News Conference 600

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: I thought maybe--I didn't have much to tell you this morning, I said it all last night--but I thought maybe you might be interested in the Hooper rating of the radio situation last night.
Sentence 5: It was 43.8 percent--32 million listeners.
Sentence 6: And 98.4 percent of all the radios that were in use were listening to the conversation.
Sentence 7: I will give you a copy of this, here.
Sentence 8: [2.]
Sentence 9: I have a letter here from General Eisenhower, which is a most interesting document; and I haven't had a chance to have it mimeographed, but will have it mimeographed for you immediately after the conference so you can all have copies.
Sentence 10: It is dated October 26, and is from the headquarters of the United States Forces in the European theater, and it is addressed to me through the Chief of Staff.
Sentence 11: I am going to read it to you because it is a very, very interesting document.
Sentence 12: Q. Slowly, will you, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 13: I will read it slowly, but I will have it mimeographed so you can all have copies, if you don't get the gist of it, but I think you will.
Sentence 14: [Reading] "You will recall that when you were in Frankfurt, you and I agreed upon the desirability of so organizing the Army's current functions in Europe as to facilitate turning U.S. participation in the government of Germany over to civil authority at the earliest possible moment.
Sentence 15: It is my understanding that the War Department completely supports this view.
Sentence 16: Every organizational step we have taken has been accomplished in such a way as to facilitate eventual transfer.
Sentence 17: Nevertheless, I am quite sure that there is a very widespread lack of realization as to the governing intent along this line, basing this statement upon the frequency with which visitors express astonishment that this purpose exists as a guiding policy.
Sentence 18: "Naturally, I am not in position to recommend an exact date on which such transfer should take place, since I have assumed that the four interested governments would first have to agree in principle, and thereafter to make arrangements for simultaneous change from military to civil representatives.
Sentence 19: Moreover, there may be considerations, important to our government, of which I am unaware.
Sentence 20: However, from our local viewpoint, other governments could well be asked to agree to the proposal at the earliest date that can be mutually agreed upon, in no event later than June 1, 1946.
Sentence 21: As quickly as the matter could be agreed in principle, but not before, then actual completion of the American civil organization should be undertaken by whatever civilian you might, at that time, designate as its eventual head.
Sentence 22: Such things as these require time, but I am confident that we should not allow this detail to obscure, in the mind of any interested person, the clarity of the objective toward which we are striving.
Sentence 23: "The matter of civil government of Germany is entirely separate from the occupational duty of the Army, which responsibility will persist as long as our own Government deems necessary.
Sentence 24: The true function of the Army in this region is to provide for the United States that reserve of force and power that can insure within our zone the prompt enforcement of all laws and regulations prescribed by the Group Council, or in the absence of such law and regulation, the policies laid down by our own Government for the United States zone.
Sentence 25: "As you pointed out when here, separation of occupational and governmental responsibility is sound just as soon as there is no longer any military or security reason for holding them together, if for no other reason than because of its conformity to the American principle of keeping the Army as such out of the civil government field.
Sentence 26: Respectfully, Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Sentence 27: "
I am in agreement with what the General has said.
Sentence 28: We discussed it while he was in Frankfurt, and eventually it will be carried out.
Sentence 29: Q. Mr. President, may I ask you, was that June 1st or June 30th--that date?
Sentence 30: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 31: June 1st, 1946.
Sentence 32: Q. Mr. President, in other words, he wants to turn over by June 1st, 1946, the--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: The civil government, which in no way affects the occupational forces as occupational forces; but the civil government would be under a civilian.
Sentence 34: Q.
Sentence 35: The American civilian has to be appointed?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 36: That's right.
Sentence 37: Q. Mr. President, have we had any expressions from the other governments on that?
Sentence 38: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 39: No.
Sentence 40: This is since I had the conversation at Frankfurt.
Sentence 41: This is the first discussion that I have had on it.
Sentence 42: And the State Department and the War Department and the President are in agreement on this policy.
Sentence 43: Q. Will the next step be to see if that can be worked out with the other governments?
Sentence 44: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 45: It will.
Sentence 46: Q. Mr. President, will the principle eventually be followed as well in Japan?
Sentence 47: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 48: Yes.
Sentence 49: Q. Mr. President, would that entail the establishment of a German police force under American command to handle the direct policing--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 50: Well, that is already in effect.
Sentence 51: Q.
Sentence 52: That would be the general principle of the--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: That is already in effect, and the military forces would be kept there merely as occupational forces to enforce the law, in case the local police could not do it.
Sentence 54: Q. Would that government be under the State Department, or would it be a separate organization?
Sentence 55: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 56: It would be a direct organization under the President of the United States.
Sentence 57: Q. Mr. President, is it in connection with that letter from General Eisenhower that General Clay has now returned to the United States-or is now returning?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: No.
Sentence 59: It has no connection.
Sentence 60: General Clay--as I know--is not returning only maybe on leave, or on some business of his own, because General Clay is one of our ablest generals, and we are trying to keep him over there.
Sentence 61: Q.
Sentence 62: He is the military government man, more or less, and I thought he might be working out--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: No.
Sentence 64: He is still working on the details of the government that is now in force over there.
Sentence 65: [3.]
Sentence 66: Q. Mr. President, it was said in the House of Commons yesterday that President Roosevelt and former Prime Minister Churchill reached a secret agreement at Quebec on the peacetime use of the atom bomb.
Sentence 67: Do you --
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 68: I don't think that is true.
Sentence 69: As nearly as I can find out on the atom energy release program, Great Britain, Canada, and the United States are in equal partnership on its development.
Sentence 70: And Mr. Attlee is coming over here to discuss that phase of the situation with the president of the United States.
Sentence 71: Q. Well, Mr. President, are these three countries in equal possession of the knowledge of how we produced that bomb?
Sentence 72: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 73: They are.
Sentence 74: Q. Great Britain knows as much about how we produce that as we do?
Sentence 75: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: They do.
Sentence 77: Q. Is that going to be the only topic that you and Mr. Attlee are going to discuss?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: That is the only topic that has been requested to be discussed.
Sentence 79: Q.
Sentence 80: But that doesn't foreclose the--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: Mr. Attlee can talk to me about anything he chooses, but he is coming over here to talk to me about the atom bomb.
Sentence 82: Q.
Sentence 83: Mr. President a London paper suggested that--I believe the London Herald, a labor paper--suggested that this might be the prelude of a new Big Three conference.
Sentence 84: Do you feel that way about it, or is there any possibility of that?
Sentence 85: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 86: I don't think I can intelligently answer that question, because the next step, after the Governments of Great Britain, Canada, and the United States have agreed on an international policy, will be to discuss the matter with the other governments of the world.
Sentence 87: [4.]
Sentence 88: Q.
Sentence 89: In connection with this Big Three, have you had any reply from Mr. Stalin from the material presented to him by Mr. Harriman?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 90: Yes, I have.
Sentence 91: Q. Is there anything you can tell us about that reply?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: It was a satisfactory reply.
Sentence 93: Q. Does that mean, Mr. President, that you expect Russia will be represented at this Far Eastern Advisory Commission meeting?
Sentence 94: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 95: I do.
Sentence 96: Q.
Sentence 97: Can you say when that reply was received, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 98: While I was in New York City making a speech on Navy Day.
Sentence 99: Q. Mr. Truman, does that also mean that there would be an early convening or reconvening of the Council of Foreign Ministers, possibly?
Sentence 100: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: I can't answer that question until further developments.
Sentence 102: Q. Mr. President, when you say you expect Russia to take part in the meeting now going on here, does that mean that an agreement has been reached on the control council?
Sentence 103: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: No.
Sentence 105: This meeting is for the purpose of discussing that program, for the other Allies to join us in the occupation of Japan.
Sentence 106: Q. Has direct acceptance or direct indication of Russia's intention to participate been received?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: No, it has not.
Sentence 108: Q.
Sentence 109: But you expect it to come in?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 110: I do.
Sentence 111: Q. Soon?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 112: Yes.
Sentence 113: Q. Did the letter from--or the answer from Marshal Stalin postulate any specific steps?
Sentence 114: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 115: No.
Sentence 116: It was just a friendly answer to my cation to him.
Sentence 117: Q. Is there any reason why it couldn't be made public, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 118: Yes, there is.
Sentence 119: When the time comes for it to be made public, that will be made public; but the reason has not yet appeared.
Sentence 120: [5.]
Sentence 121: Q.
Sentence 122: What do you think about the legislation reported out by the House Military Affairs Committee yesterday, on prescribing penalties for breaking no-strike contracts?
Sentence 123: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 124: When that comes to me for consideration, I will give you my opinion of it.
Sentence 125: Q. Mr. President
Q. Mr. President, do you have any answer from Mr. Attlee on the Palestine question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 126: Let the lady ask her question, and then I will answer you.
Sentence 127: [6.]
Sentence 128: Q. Mr. President, would you assent to Congress recessing before it has dealt with the legislation you dealt with last night?
Sentence 129: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 130: The Congress has a right to vote its own recess, but I hope the Congress will not recess until the program is finished.
Sentence 131: Q. Doesn't the Congress usually ask the President if he has further business?
Sentence 132: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 133: I haven't been here long enough to answer that question.
Sentence 134: [Laughter] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be sarcastic.
Sentence 135: [7.]
Sentence 136: Q. Mr. President, last week you told us that the Crowley letter was "somewhere around the White House."
Sentence 137: Could you tell us whether--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 138: It had been released.
Sentence 139: The one to which I had referred had been released.
Sentence 140: 1

Sentence 141: Q.
Sentence 142: There is no other letter?
Sentence 143: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 144: No other letter for release.
Sentence 145: I have had several letters from Mr. Crowley.
Sentence 146: The conversation with Mr. Crowley on his resignation from his job was verbal, and took place right here in this office, and I let him go reluctantly.
Sentence 147: [8.]
Sentence 148: Q. Mr. President, I repeat that question, have you had any answer from Mr. Attlee on the Palestine question?
Sentence 149: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: I have had two or three messages from Mr. Attlee with regard to the Palestine question.
Sentence 151: Q. Would you care to give us any indication as to what our Government's policy is in regard to that?
Sentence 152: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 153: No, because it is still under discussion.
Sentence 154: 1

Sentence 159: I have several people under consideration.
Sentence 160: Q. Is Mr. Crowley still on that list?
Sentence 161: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 163: [10.]
Sentence 164: Q. Mr. President, have you named the Government delegate to the ILO meeting in Denmark next month?
Sentence 165: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 166: I don't think I have.
Sentence 167: There have been so many things across my desk, I can't remember having made that.
Sentence 168: I will look it up here and find out.

Sentence 178: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 179: That's pretty good.
Sentence 180: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 181: That matter has not entered my thoughts.
Sentence 182: I am too busy with other things.
Sentence 183: Q. Is Mr. Hannegan too busy?
THE PRESIDENT.
