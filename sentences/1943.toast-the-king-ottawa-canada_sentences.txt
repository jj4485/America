Sentence 1: 1943 Toast The King Ottawa Canada

I wish that I might go with you to the Yukon, and to Alaska.
Sentence 2: In these days of planes and cars, distances seem nothing.
Sentence 3: That, perhaps, is the reason why this is my first trip to Canada.
Sentence 4: One always goes to the nearest places last.
Sentence 5: But, of course, both in Quebec and here, when anybody has spoken of my visit to this Capital, I cannot help remembering that I started coming to Canada 59 years ago—and meant to every year since.
Sentence 6: I won't express any preference for the seaboard or the interior, but the seaboard is a very charming place.
Sentence 7: And its fish, while of a different character, are just as beautiful as the fish of Georgian Bay.
Sentence 8: I have never been in the Northwest.
Sentence 9: I am one of those amphibious creatures who has visited Victoria, but never Vancouver; so I have a great deal still to see.
Sentence 10: Mr. King has talked with me for many years about going to see the Prairie States.
Sentence 11: I have never had that opportunity.
Sentence 12: As a matter of fact, four years ago, when the King and Queen were here and came to Hyde Park, he was able to tell me far more about Canada as a whole than I knew from my own experience.
Sentence 13: And I hope very much that because I have had the privilege of knowing you for a great many years, that he will come over again one of these days—the sooner the better—to visit you, and visit us below the line.
Sentence 14: And so I give a toast to the King.
