THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: Gentlemen, and ladies, some of you, I think, haven't--you were not in here yesterday when we were showing the picture here, which is, I think, a treasure.
Sentence 4: Now it is public property.
Sentence 5: We have dosed the deal on it on Lincoln's birthday, and are able to announce that it is public property.
Sentence 6: And I hope to hang it out in the lobby where a lot of people can see it, or in the National Gallery of Art.
Sentence 7: I just put it up there--[indicating the wall]--temporarily so the picture men could take pictures of it.
Sentence 8: It is very interesting.
Sentence 9: If you haven't read the release that we put out on it, I would suggest that everyone read it, because it is an interesting thing.
Sentence 10: That picture of Lincoln there, that is the original of the official picture that hangs over the mantel in the State Dining Room in the White House.

On February 12 the White House announced that the President had authorized the purchase by the Government of a historical painting, "The Peacemakers," depicting President Lincoln, Generals Grant and Sherman, and Admiral Porter in conference aboard the steamship "River Queen" during the last days of the Civil War.
Sentence 12: The picture, the work of George P. A. Healy, the release stated, was painted shortly after the war.
Sentence 13: The artist was not present at the meeting near Richmond.
Sentence 14: However, he had previously painted individual portraits of the four and he had obtained the data from which he worked from General Sherman.
Sentence 15: The portrait of President Lincoln in the State Dining Room, also the work of Mr. Healy, the release added, is believed to have been a replica of the one in the group picture.
Sentence 16: Robert Todd Lincoln, in a letter to a friend many years later, described the history of both pictures in some detail.
Sentence 17: Of the portrait he wrote, "I have never seen a portrait of my father which is to be compared with it in any way."

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 21: No.
Sentence 22: That's a matter that we'll have to work out.
Sentence 23: I went into the whole rubber situation while I was in the Senate, and made the report which finally wound up as the rubber policy of the United States Government.
Sentence 24: Of course, I think it is necessary for us to maintain and stand by synthetic plants so that we will not be caught as we were in the--in this Second World War, although we all hope and are working toward the end that there will be no more world wars.
Sentence 25: [3.]

Q. That has been mimeographed, sir?

Sentence 36: That is to say, I intend to Bert Andrews of the New York Herald Tribune.
Sentence 37: continue to act in this office as the agent of the American people, without regard to my personal political fortunes.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: Well, the Committee ought to know.
Sentence 65: I didn't.

Q.
Sentence 67: But one reason was that the only date they could get the hotel was nearer Jefferson than Jackson.
