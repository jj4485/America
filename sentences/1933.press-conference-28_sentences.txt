Sentence 1: 1933 Press Conference 28

THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 2: I understand that in some mysterious and subterranean way you got the suggestion that Frank Murphy is going as Governor to the Philippines.
Sentence 3: I guess you are right.
Sentence 4: Q. Frank Murphy of Detroit?
Sentence 5: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 6: Yes, Mayor of Detroit.
Sentence 7: Q.
Sentence 8: When will he go?
Sentence 9: THE PRESIDENT: I don't think I have sent the nomination yet.
Sentence 10: It will go up Monday.
Sentence 11: Q. Does that mean that Homer Cummings will stay as Attorney General?
Sentence 12: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 13: Yes.
Sentence 14: And then somebody guessed that Chip Robert is going in as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
Sentence 15: That is right too.
Sentence 16: I cannot tell you anything about diplomatic appointments because there are two or three on the way and we have not heard from the foreign countries as yet. . . .
Sentence 17: Q. Have you been able to cash that first pay check?
Sentence 18: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 19: Yes, I cashed it and I am sending back my 15 per-cent.
Sentence 20: Q.
Sentence 21: What is that?
Sentence 22: THE PRESIDENT: Dollars—$843.75.
Sentence 23: And I am also sending my dues to the National Press Club.
Sentence 24: Q.
Sentence 25: That is foolish.
Sentence 26: Q.
Sentence 27: That is on your first month's pay, is it?
Sentence 28: THE PRESIDENT: Up to the first of April. . .
Sentence 29: .
Sentence 30: Q. Would you like to make some comment on the effect on employment by reason of the production of beer?
Sentence 31: THE PRESIDENT: Nothing.
Sentence 32: Maybe later on this evening, I may.
Sentence 33: Q. I can right now.
Sentence 34: (Laughter)
Q. How many cases have you gotten thus far?
Sentence 35: THE PRESIDENT: I can't say anything on the record.
Sentence 36: But all reports we are getting in is that the actual employment that has resulted from the manufacture of beer is bigger than the estimate; and the amount of beer manufactured during the month is running away ahead of the Treasury estimates.
Sentence 37: Q.
Sentence 38: I want to thank you for sending the beer to the Press Club.
Sentence 39: THE PRESIDENT: It got there all right?
Sentence 40: Fine.
Sentence 41: Q. There have been reports of the Administration coming around again to inflation and I wonder if you will say something about that— I mean actual inflation of the currency.
Sentence 42: THE PRESIDENT: No, not putting it that way.
Sentence 43: I will tell you, off the record, about the problem.
Sentence 44: After all, you ought to know it.
Sentence 45: It is an old story.
Sentence 46: So much of the legislation we have had this spring is of a deflationary character, in the sense that it locks up money or prevents the flow of money, that we are faced with the problem of offsetting that in some way.
Sentence 47: I would not say "inflation of the currency," because that is not the necessary meaning.
Sentence 48: You see, upon the closing of the banks we put away somewhere around four billion dollars.
Sentence 49: It was probably locked up before, but people did not know it.
Sentence 50: Now it is locked up, and people do know it.
Sentence 51: That is deflationary.
Sentence 52: The effect of cutting very nearly a billion dollars off the Government payroll, including the veterans' cuts, cutting down of departments and cutting off 15 percent of employees' pay—it would probably run to perhaps not quite a billion dollars but very nearly that-means that much loss in the flow of money.
Sentence 53: That is deflationary.
Sentence 54: Now, on the other side of the picture, we have C.C.C. (see Items 21, 31, 90 and 113 of this volume) giving employment to about 250,000 people in the forests and on works of various kinds.
Sentence 55: That is only $250,000,000 as an offset.
Sentence 56: Then there is $500,000,000 as an offset on direct relief to the States.
Sentence 57: (See Items 21, 55 and 75 of this volume.)
Sentence 58: That means we have not yet caught up with the deflation that we have already caused.
Sentence 59: Therefore, of course, we are going to talk about methods to give more people work or to raise commodity prices, which would . .
Sentence 60: .
Sentence 61: Q.
Sentence 62: The Farm Bill would do it.
Sentence 63: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 64: The Farm Bill would do it, of course, because it will raise commodity prices.
Sentence 65: The Farm Mortgage Bill and the Home Credit Bill (see Items 39 and 74 of this volume) will help because they will cut down the debt obligations of the small, individual family man—the home man.
Sentence 66: That is all to the good.
Sentence 67: Q. Lower rentals . . .
Sentence 68: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 69: But the question is whether all those things are really inflationary.
Sentence 70: They are helpful.
Sentence 71: Q.
Sentence 72: Might we have an expression from you that there is no disposition on the part of the Administration to inflate the currency itself?
Sentence 73: I mean to print currency in a manner other than has been done.
Sentence 74: THE PRESIDENT: What do you mean, start the printing presses?
Sentence 75: Q. Yes.
Sentence 76: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 77: Off the record, we are not going to start the printing presses.
Sentence 78: That is silly.
Sentence 79: Q. Mr. President, are you ready to define what you consider a sound currency as expressed in your Inaugural Message?
Sentence 80: In your Inaugural Message you said you were going to stand for a sound currency.
Sentence 81: THE PRESIDENT: I am not going to write a book on it.
Sentence 82: Q.
Sentence 83: Can you say how much the public works program will overcome the five-billion-dollar deflation which you have mentioned?
Sentence 84: THE PRESIDENT: That is very hard to tell.
Sentence 85: You can figure it twenty different ways.
Sentence 86: I don't know.
Sentence 87: Q. Has any consideration been given to paying off deposits in closed banks or, rather, to facilitate the paying off of deposits?
Sentence 88: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 89: Yes, we are talking about that now.
Sentence 90: Q. Couldn't you allow us to discuss this on our own authority —what you have stated about inflation and deflation?
Sentence 91: You said it was off the record.
Sentence 92: THE PRESIDENT: It has been printed lots and lots of times.
Sentence 93: There is nothing new in it.
Sentence 94: We know that a great' many of the measures have been deflationary; and we know too that a few of the measures have been somewhat inflationary in the sense of giving people work.
Sentence 95: But we know that we have not yet got to the point of equalizing; and that we probably must do more.
Sentence 96: I don't like the word "inflationary" because no two people agree on the definition of it.
Sentence 97: It is better to say that we have got to do something more to give people more work.
Sentence 98: Q.
Sentence 99: May we use that as background?
Sentence 100: THE PRESIDENT: I think so.
Sentence 101: Q.
Sentence 102: That is, this last part?
Sentence 103: Q.
Sentence 104: Your whole discussion or just what you said last?
Sentence 105: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 106: No, just what I said last.
Sentence 107: I will hold it down to that. . . .
