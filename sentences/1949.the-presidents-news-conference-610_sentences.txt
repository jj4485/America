Sentence 5: Q. Mr. President, is Mr. Kenneth Royall also resigning?
Sentence 6: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 7: No--he has not.
Sentence 8: Q. Did you talk with Mr. Royall this afternoon?
Sentence 9: He came out--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 10: He stopped in to see me about another matter--not that.
Sentence 11: Q. Mr. President, has Mr. Forrestal resigned at his own request, or yours ?

Sentence 21: Q. Mr. President, did you say Mr. Royall is not resigning?

Sentence 23: [2.]
Sentence 24: Q. Mr. President, how about these meetings you have been having at night with industrial leaders
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: They are my--they are my private business, and there is no comment on it.
Sentence 26: [3.]
Sentence 27: Q. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago we asked you about possible relaxation of credit controls, and at that time you said
you did not have them in mind.
Sentence 28: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 29: That's right.
Sentence 30: Q.
Sentence 31: As they were relaxed, could you give us some idea of what happened in the meantime that caused you to change?
Sentence 32: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: The matter was under consideration by the Federal Reserve Board, and by the Board of Economic Advisers, and by the Senate-House Committees on economic reports; and between us we all came to the conclusion that some relaxation was necessary, and that's the reason it was done.
Sentence 34: 1
1 The installment-buying changes announced by the Federal Reserve Board on March 2 extended the period of installment payments to 21 months instead of the 15 to 18 months formerly permitted.
Sentence 35: The Board also reduced down payments from the previous 20 percent requirement to 15 percent, except in the case of automobiles where a 33 1/3 percent down payment was still required
Q.
Sentence 36: Could you give us a little bit of the reasoning that led you to do it, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 37: Well, haven't you been familiar with the economic situation as it has developed?
Sentence 38: Q.
Sentence 39: Well, if I have, I would like to get you to say it.
Sentence 40: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 41: You won't do that.
Sentence 42: Q. Mr. President, do you plan to ask for extension of consumer credit regulations beyond June 30th ?
Sentence 43: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: Yes.
Sentence 45: Q. Mr. President, in the report of the Council of Economic Advisers that was transmitted with your economic message, they said to abandon the restraining influences at this time would increase our vulnerability to inflationary strains.
Sentence 46: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: That is correct.
Sentence 48: You see, the objective of the Full Employment Act of 1946 was to put us in a position to meet either a spiral going up or one going down, and that is--those powers are being used within--in the commonsense way to prevent the thing from going in either direction.
Sentence 49: Q. Does this mean that the spiral is going down ?
Sentence 50: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 51: Not necessarily.
Sentence 52: Q. Is it going up ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: It's going both ways.
Sentence 54: [Laughter] I will prove it to you.
Sentence 55: The only fall in prices has been in farm products.
Sentence 56: Lead, zinc, and iron, and all those things that go to make up building materials are on the same spiral they have always been, and so we are trying to get that thing leveled off by 'putting a roof on the spiral going up and putting a floor on the spiral going down.
Sentence 57: That is the objective of the whole thing.
Sentence 58: That is the reason the bill was passed.
Sentence 59: [4.]
Sentence 60: Q.
Sentence 61: [The White House Official Reporter's note follows: "Completely inaudible to this reporter, but referred to whether the President would urge rigid support of farm prices at 90 percent of parity."

Sentence 68: He charged in a letter supposed to have been sent you today that Governor Wallgren was associating with Communists?
Sentence 69: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: I haven't received any such letter, and if I do receive one which has been given out before its arrival at the White House, I will have no comment on it.
Sentence 71: 2
2 The letter from Senator Harry P. Cain of Washington was printed, with related documents, in the Congressional Record of March 3 (vol. 95, p. 1770).
Sentence 72: It expressed Senator Cain's opposition to the appointment of former Governor Mort Wallgren as chairman of the National Security Resources Board.
Sentence 73: In the letter the Senator stated, "My opposition to Mr. Wallgren is both firm and honest.
Sentence 74: In the problem before us I respectfully suggest that the nominee, while perhaps possessing virtues required by some assignments, is singularly lacking in what you require from advisers and assistants whose sole objective is that of keeping our nation free at home and secure against aggression from abroad."
Sentence 75: [6.]
Sentence 76: Q. Mr. President, would you name the special interests to which you made reference several times, sir?
Sentence 77: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: It would not be difficult to name them, Joe,
3
but then I don't think I need to name them for a reporter of the Baltimore Sun.
Sentence 79: They know the special interests and support them all the time.
Sentence 80: [Laughter]
3
Joseph H. Short of the Baltimore Sun.
Q.
Sentence 81: And some others, too.
Sentence 82: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 83: Oh yes, I agree with that.
Sentence 84: It depends altogether on what your viewpoint is.
Sentence 85: Special interests is one that is against the general public interest.
Sentence 86: It doesn't make any difference what sector of the population it's in.
Sentence 87: [7.].

Sentence 117: Q. Would you care to comment beyond Key West?

Sentence 120: [12.]
Sentence 121: Q. May I return one minute to the B-50 flight--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 122: Sure.
