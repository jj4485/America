"The Second Year of Peace, Eighth Report to the President, the Senate & the House of Representatives by the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion," dated October 1, 1946 (Government Printing Office, 1946, 76 pp.).
Sentence 7: [Reading, not literally]: "Of the total labor force of 60 million, 58 million have jobs.
Sentence 8: For most of the 2 million who are looking for work, the periods of unemployment are short, and in most cases unemployed workers draw compensation while they are looking for new jobs.
Sentence 9: "Ten million veterans are gainfully employed today, compared with only 2 million at work on V-J Day--a gain of 8 million jobs for veterans in a year.
Sentence 10: But the total of unemployed veterans is still higher than any of us like to see it--about 900,000 or almost half the total of the unemployed.
Sentence 11: It is the Nation's responsibility to see to it that veterans looking for jobs get satisfactory employment at the highest level of their skills and at good wages.
Sentence 12: "More than 800,000 veterans are enrolled in college this fall and are receiving the education their country promised them under the GI bill of rights.
Sentence 13: "More than 350,000 dwelling units have been completed and are ready for occupancy under the Veterans' Emergency Housing Program.
Sentence 14: This record is creditable, but we are going to make it better.
Sentence 15: The reconversion agencies are doing their utmost to speed up the construction of veterans' housing of all types.
Sentence 16: "And business profits, after taxes, are at an all-time high in the Nation's history, in spite of the fact that in some important industries they are still lagging.
Sentence 17: Income payments to individuals are also the highest in total they have ever been.
Sentence 18: Farm income, too, is at record levels.
Sentence 19: Consumer spending is high--the public is spending at the rate of $126 billion a year for consumer goods and services, and more than 20 percent over the war peak, and more than 60 percent over the prewar peak.
Sentence 20: "Since V-J Day, total production of goods and services by private industry has moved steadily ahead, and has now reached the annual rate of $172 billion.
Sentence 21: Making allowances for increased prices, consumer nondurables such as food and clothing are still being produced and sold at a very high level.
Sentence 22: Good progress has been made in the production of many consumer durable goods-we have already surpassed 1940 or 1941 production levels in the case of electric irons, vacuum cleaners, passenger and truck tires, electric ranges, washing machines, radios, trucks, and buses.
Sentence 23: Production curve of refrigerators, passenger automobiles, gas ranges, and sewing machines is rising, and during the next few months we should have an increasing flow of these and other finished goods.
Sentence 24: "All this adds up to a splendid achievement.
Sentence 25: But we must not pause to congratulate ourselves.
Sentence 26: A difficult struggle lies before us.
Sentence 27: We must do our utmost to keep industrial peace, to maintain production at present levels where it is high, and to spur it to higher levels where it is lagging.
Sentence 28: "I hope every businessman, worker, farmer, and consumer will take to heart this sentence from Mr. Steelman's report: 'An all-out emphasis on production of finished goods, and on preventing a further increase in prices, is the task immediately before us.'
