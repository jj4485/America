Sentence 1: 1930 The Presidents News Conference 735

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I haven't anything for publication this morning.
Sentence 3: I have one or two questions on prohibition that I don't mind talking to you a little about from the point of view of background, but I don't care to enter into any public discussions on the subject at the present time.
Sentence 4: STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT
Sentence 5: The questions I have relate to the matter of State enforcement.
Sentence 6: There is nothing in the program which has been proposed here that has any intention of taking over the responsibilities of the States in any shape or form.
Sentence 7: Our proposals are merely to correct the deficits in our administrative machinery, and are purely Federal.
Sentence 8: We have no notion of relieving the States of responsibilities or extending the Federal activities beyond their proper relationships with the States.
Sentence 9: And that covers all the questions I have, so that is all I can give you today.
Sentence 10: Q. Is there any proposal, Mr. President, to increase the responsibilities of the States?
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 12: That matter has not been taken up at all.
Sentence 13: It no doubt will come up in the Law Enforcement Commission, as they are considering everything.
Sentence 14: I have no doubt they will have that under consideration in time if they have not already--that I do not know.
