Sentence 1: 1929 The Presidents News Conference 833

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: This being the day that you get 10 or 15 columns from me I do not believe I can adequately add anything to it, so we had better hold in reserve any news we have here until we run dry.
Sentence 3: FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE BUDGET
I have had here for some months a sort of a personal budget that I thought might be of interest to you after you have done with the budget message, and I will have the tables gotten out and released to you.
Sentence 4: It is a reconsideration of Government expenditures on a more understandable basis than that on which we have to present the departmental budgets.
Sentence 5: The budget as it goes to Congress, of course, is built up by departments, and not by the particular purpose for which expenditures of the Government are made.
Sentence 6: For instance, each department has regulatory functions, and these are functions in aid of different purposes throughout the country, and does not give as clear a vision of the operations of the Government as constituted for the purposes for which the expenditure is made.
Sentence 7: So I thought--not for publication--but I will release it to you as soon as we get it mimeographed--probably let you have it for release on Thursday after you are done with the normal budget.
Sentence 8: It will probably give the public a better understanding as to what all these figures are about.
Sentence 9: Q. Will we get that this afternoon, Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 10: This afternoon or tomorrow morning.
