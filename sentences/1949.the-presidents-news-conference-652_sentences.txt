Sentence 6: I suppose you have heard about them?

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 8: No, I can't give you any new slant on them.
Sentence 9: I think the figures speak for themselves.

Q.
Sentence 22: I believe the report mentions an upturn in production, too?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 23: Yes.
Sentence 24: Six percent.
Sentence 25: Six point--six point, not percent.
Sentence 26: [2.]
Sentence 27: Q. Mr. President, a great many people are interested in the rather sad fact that Dr. Basil O'Connor's speech last night--possibly you heard it?--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 28: Yes.
Sentence 29: Q.--40,000 new cases of polio in this country this year, a record number, and he has opened an emergency drive for a certain amount of money.
Sentence 30: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 31: I am wholeheartedly in sympathy with that drive.
Sentence 32: I am hoping it will be successful, because we are faced with an emergency in that polio epidemic that is now going on.

Sentence 43: Q. Which campaign is that?
Sentence 44: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 45: The 1950 campaign.

Sentence 55: In the election Mr. Dulles was defeated by former Governor Herbert H. Lehman.
Sentence 56: [5.]
Sentence 57: Q. Mr. President, along that same line, would you give us your definition of "statism"?
Sentence 58: THE PRESIDENT.

THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 72: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 73: I see.
Sentence 74: Q.
Sentence 75: They have asked me to tell you that there is a great resurgence of vaudeville, and their attitude toward it is that it is not only coming back--it's an old-time thing--but a lot of people are getting reemployment.
Sentence 76: Now, that planted question: to say something nice about them?
Sentence 77: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: That is not hard to do, because when I was much younger, between the time I was about 16 to 20, I used to go to every vaudeville show that came to Kansas City at the old Orpheum, and at the Grand theater where the four Cohans, and Eva Tanguay, and all those people used to go.
Sentence 79: I used to have a job as an usher on Saturday afternoons.
Sentence 80: All I got out of it was to see a show, which was for nothing.
Sentence 81: I am glad that vaudeville is coming back.
Sentence 82: Q.
Sentence 83: What did you do on Saturday afternoons?
Sentence 84: Q. Were--you were a baby-sitter?
Q.
Sentence 85: I didn't get that?
Sentence 86: [Laughter]

Sentence 94: Q.
Sentence 95: That was in Kansas City, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: Kansas City.
Sentence 97: Q.
Sentence 98: We will put a plaque up there tomorrow!
Sentence 99: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: That's where all the good shows came to--Kansas City.
Sentence 101: Q. Were you around when William Woods--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 102: Willis Woods.
Sentence 103: Oh yes, Willis Woods was around a long time after the Grand.
Sentence 104: Q. Mr. President, how did the Orpheum figure in it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 105: At the Orpheum I had to pay my way into that.
Sentence 106: That was the vaudeville show.
Sentence 107: Once the Orpheum Circuit.
Sentence 108: There used to be one here, Keith-Orpheum it turned out to be afterwards.

Sentence 111: Q. Mr. President, Mrs. Roosevelt in her column yesterday referred to the riot at Peekskill as disgraceful.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 122: That is just one out of the whole cloth.
Sentence 123: I never heard of it before.
Sentence 124: [10.]
Sentence 125: Q. Mr. President, will you ask for an extension of the steel strike truce?
Sentence 126: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 127: It is under consideration.
Sentence 128: I can't do anything about it until I see the report of the fact-finding board, and I won't receive that report until tomorrow--
Q.
Sentence 129: What was the question?
Sentence 130: THE PRESIDENT.--I mean Saturday.
Sentence 131: Q.
Sentence 132: What was the question, please?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 142: I haven't seen the telegram.
Sentence 143: I guess they gave it out before it got to here.
Sentence 144: They do that--they have a habit of doing that.
Sentence 145: We are doing everything we possibly can, of course, to survey that strike, following every phase of the Railroad Labor Act to try to prevent the strike.
Sentence 146: I don't know whether it can be prevented or not.
Sentence 147: Q.
Sentence 148: What can you do in that case, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 149: Well, I am trying to find--
Q. Have you exhausted all your--
THE PRESIDENT.--we have exhausted nearly everything, but we are still trying to prevent a strike by every means possible-reason, principally.
Sentence 150: [12.]
Sentence 151: Q. Mr. President, there are reports that Stanton Griffis will be appointed Ambassador to Argentina?

Sentence 180: Well, I don't know how soon it will be.
Sentence 181: It takes a little time.
Sentence 182: You know, the most important thing that I do as President, in my opinion, is to appoint Federal judges.
Sentence 183: I make it a rule not to appoint a man a Federal judge unless I think he is eminently qualified for that service, because they will survive me a long time as public servants, and the welfare of the country is really in the hands of the judiciary, because they get right down and decide what is right or wrong between individuals.

Sentence 222: You haven't decided?
Sentence 223: THE PRESIDENT.
