Sentence 6: Q. Mr. President, could you say which paintings you liked in that German collection in the National Gallery?
Sentence 7: Also, whether you favor keeping those paintings in the United States and sending them on a tour and charging admission and helping German children?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 8: That sounds to me as if you had some preparation on that one.

Sentence 10: I have made two trips to see them, and I was particularly interested in Rembrandt's "Moses," and Titian's "Portrait of Himself."
Sentence 11: One I really wanted to see was the Holbein picture, "The Merchant," which is considered the finest portrait in the world; and Frans Hals has some pictures there that were very appealing to me.
Sentence 12: That is the sort of art that I like, that I can understand.
Sentence 13: About the return of the pictures: it is my opinion that they should be returned as promptly as possible to their rightful owners, as soon as it is safe for them to be returned.

Mr. President, the St. Louis Star Times, in a recent editorial called "A Memo to the White House," a copy of which was sent to you, I believe, pointed out that one attempt might be made to save our bid for peace if we invited the nations, including Russia, to a conference on the question of a real world government.
