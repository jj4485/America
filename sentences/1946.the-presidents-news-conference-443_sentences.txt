Sentence 1: 1946 The Presidents News Conference 443

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I have a most interesting letter which I would like to read to you this morning, from the famous Dean of Canterbury, Mr. Hewlett Johnson.
Sentence 4: He says:
"My dear Mr. President:"--
This is dated 31st of January, 1946â€¢
--"May I categorically deny a statement, which I understand has appeared in the American press, that I regarded America as 100 years behind in everything save religion and 150 years behind in that."
Sentence 5: [Laughter] "That statement, which is of course ridiculous, was made in a jocular mood by my predecessor."
Sentence 6: [More laughter]
"I neither endorsed such a statement, nor do I think it is true.
Sentence 7: "I believe and constantly affirm that America leads the world in industrial adventure, activity and achievement.
Sentence 8: Indeed, I am accused in England of over-enthusiasm for America's achievement.
Sentence 9: "I am convinced that we in Europe have rich lessons to learn from America, especially in enterprise and the arts of production.
Sentence 10: "I believe also that America may learn in the future from some European experiments in distribution and planned economy.
Sentence 11: "I only write because had such a statement really been made by me, it would have shown the most gross ingratitude for the over-abundant kindness I received from you and your countrymen.
Sentence 12: "
If anybody wants a copy of that letter, we will furnish it.
Sentence 13: [2.]
Sentence 14: Now to get down to serious things, I am particularly interested in this food situation.
Sentence 15: In most of the wheat-producing countries of the world, outside of the United States and Canada, there has been almost a total crop failure in wheat.
Sentence 16: Australia's crop is a failure.
Sentence 17: South Africa had a drought.
Sentence 18: All Europe suffered from a drought, so far as the wheat situation is concerned.
Sentence 19: And in the far East, the production of rice in India is from 12 to 15 percent short of the usual crop, and they are always an importing country on that part of their food, and they import from Burma and Siam and Indochina.
Sentence 20: Those countries' rice crops are, of course, a total failure on account of the fact that they have--were in this war situation, and they also have had adverse weather conditions along with the war situation.
Sentence 21: The Japanese crop, I am informed, is 15 percent short of normal, and they import usually 15 percent of their rice for food.
Sentence 22: It is proposed under this program which we have inaugurated, that we hope to be able to ship 6 million tons of wheat in the first half of 1946.
Sentence 23: Now, if anybody needs a lesson in arithmetic, that is about 200 million bushels.
Sentence 24: The measures ordered should make it possible for us to come closer to what we want to do by about 500,000 or a million tons.
Sentence 25: Wheat and other food products which we plan to export during the first 6 months of this year will provide 50 million people with a diet of 2,000 calories a day, or 100 million with 1,000 calories a day for a 6 months' period.
Sentence 26: Now, some of the people in the devastated countries of Europe are living on much less than 1,500 calories a day.
Sentence 27: We eat about 3,300 here in the United States.
Sentence 28: The situation is so serious that we felt it was absolutely essential to take every measure possible to help keep the people in these countries from starving; because in those countries which are our friends and allies, they are not to blame for the situation.
Sentence 29: And in enemy countries we can't afford to see our enemies starve, even if they did bring this situation on themselves.
Sentence 30: We can't do that and live according to our own ideals.
Sentence 31: We have asked Canada and Australia, and all the countries which are supposed to have surplus foods, to join us in this program; and I think every one of them will.
Sentence 32: If you want a copy of these figures and things, Mr. Ayers will be able to furnish them to you after the conference.
Sentence 33: Q. Mr. President, is it possible we may have meat rationing as a--may we have to come to that eventually?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 34: I hope not.
Sentence 35: If the packing plants can run at full blast, it will not be necessary.
Sentence 36: If it becomes necessary, in order to keep 10 or 15 million people from starving to death, I think we ought to do it.
Sentence 37: Q. Mr. President, can you throw any light, in that connection on that same story, in your meeting with the Cabinet?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: That is substantially the statement that was issued yesterday as adopted by the Cabinet as a whole.
Sentence 39: Q. Mr. President, under the Potsdam Declaration, the rations of the Germans should be no higher than the European average?
Sentence 40: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 41: That's right.
Sentence 42: Q. Does this worldwide shortage, particularly as it affects Europe, indicate there will have to be a cut in German rations?
Sentence 43: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: There will probably have to be a cut in the whole European ration.
Sentence 45: There is a cut in the whole European ration now.
Sentence 46: That is what we are trying to meet.
Sentence 47: We are trying our best to meet the thing on as equitable a basis as we possibly can.
Sentence 48: Q.
Sentence 49: But this thousand calories would be less than the Germans are getting.
Sentence 50: Are we going to feed the enemy better than our allies?
Sentence 51: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: No, we are not.
Sentence 53: That is what we are trying to prevent.
Sentence 54: We are not going to do that.
Sentence 55: We are going to take care of our allies first.
Sentence 56: That figure is in Poland and Germany, principally.
Sentence 57: Q.
Sentence 58: I was thinking of Poland, that is what I mean.
Sentence 59: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 60: Poland and Germany.
Sentence 61: But we certainly are not going to treat our allies worse than our enemies, you can be assured of that.
Sentence 62: Q. Mr. President, are there any mechanical difficulties in milling the flour?
Sentence 63: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: I don't know.
Sentence 65: I don't know enough about the milling business to answer the question.
Sentence 66: Q. Mr. President, can you say whether there is any problem of hoarding wheat in other countries at the present time?
Sentence 67: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 68: I am not familiar with it, if there is.
Sentence 69: Q. Mr. President, in connection with the extraction order, there are some rough spots in the milling industry, and I take it that the objection to that order is to get the wheat and the order--you would not object to the order being workable or flexible, so long as you got the wheat?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: That's the point exactly.
Sentence 71: And I think we will get their cooperation-I don't think there will be anybody who isn't anxious to keep people from starving to death.
Sentence 72: It's un-American, I think, to have the idea to let people starve.
Sentence 73: Q. Mr. President, when you were discussing this with the experts--with the agricultural people particularly--did they bring up details of this wheat shortage--grain shortage--in certain areas where farmers would be anxious to keep the wheat right with them, and you have to get it out?
Sentence 74: Is that part of the problem?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 75: Yes.
Sentence 76: I think every phase has been gone into by the agricultural experts.
Sentence 77: Q.
Sentence 78: Any particular answer to that situation ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: I can't give you an answer to that.
Sentence 80: We hope that this situation will work out.
Sentence 81: The reports that have been made indicate that everybody seems to think it answers the purpose.
Sentence 82: Q. Mr. President, if there will be no rationing here, are the mechanics such that we will cut down, just not buy so much; that is, the American people--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 83: Yes.
Sentence 84: Make contributions, just like they would clothing and everything else.
Sentence 85: I think they will do that.
Sentence 86: I think they will be pleased to do that.
Sentence 87: Q. Mr. President, who will handle the equitable distribution of these food supplies in the various countries?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 88: UNRRA will handle most of it.
Sentence 89: Q.
Sentence 90: It will continue under UNRRA?
Sentence 91: THE PRESIDENT, Yes.
Sentence 92: Q. Mr. President, does this 6 million tons represent an increase in our commitments, or a decrease in our commitments?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 93: No.
Sentence 94: There is, I think, a slight decrease in our first commitments.
Sentence 95: You will have to get those figures categorically from the Secretary of Agriculture, who has been the conferee with our allies in this setup.
Sentence 96: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us what estimate you have on wheat saving from the livestock reduction program?
Sentence 97: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 98: About--between 25 and 50 million bushels.
Sentence 99: Q.
Sentence 100: Well, do you believe that this saving is justified in the light of the danger of short liquidation of livestock?
Sentence 101: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 102: I don't think there will be any short liquidation of livestock.
Sentence 103: Livestock will be slaughtered at a lighter weight than they ordinarily would.
Sentence 104: And 225-pound hogs will, I think, make just as good eating as 300-pound ones; and I used to raise them.
Sentence 105: Q.
Sentence 106: [Aside] Better.
Sentence 107: [3.]
Sentence 108: Q. Mr. President, about Mr. Pauley.
Sentence 109: Are you going to withdraw his nomination?
Sentence 110: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: I am not.
Sentence 112: I am backing Mr. Pauley.
Sentence 113: I think Mr. Pauley is an honest man, and I don't think he is the only honest man in Washington or in the oil business.
Sentence 114: Q. Have you any comment?
Sentence 115: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 116: I think he is a very capable administrator, because he was the Reparations Director up until just recently and did a magnificent job in that, and I have the utmost confidence in him.
Sentence 117: Q. Did Secretary Ickes advise you of his testimony before?
Sentence 118: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 119: No, he did not.
Sentence 120: I didn't discuss it with him.
Sentence 121: Q.
Sentence 122: Do you intend to now?
Sentence 123: THE PRESIDENT, No.
Q.
Sentence 124: Mr. President, did Ed Flynn confide in you yesterday, when he was going to leave your office, that he was going to criticize Mr. Ickes?
Sentence 125: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 126: No, he did not.
Sentence 127: I didn't discuss Mr. Ickes with Mr. Flynn.
Sentence 128: He was discussing other matters.
Sentence 129: Q.
Sentence 130: Can you tell us what you were discussing, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: It was political matters in the State of New York.
Sentence 132: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, you don't consider that this situation involves anything at all, any change in your relations with Mr. Ickes?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 133: I don't think so.
Sentence 134: Mr. Ickes can very well be mistaken the same as the rest of us.
Sentence 135: [4.]
Sentence 136: Q. Mr. President, how is the price-what is the situation on the wage-price balance?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 137: I hope to be able to make a complete statement on that in a day or two.
Sentence 138: I can't do it now.
Sentence 139: Q. Will it come today possibly?
Sentence 140: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 141: I don't think so.
Sentence 142: Q. Do you anticipate, sir, that that would bring on an early settlement of the steel and other big strikes?
Sentence 143: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 144: I hope so.
Sentence 145: Q. Mr. President, has the administration made any suggestions on that wage-price formula that may be under consideration by U.S. Steel and Labor in their current sessions?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 146: I haven't discussed the matter with either one, up to the present time.
Sentence 147: Q.
Sentence 148: I was wondering whether Mr. Snyder may have passed it along for some suggestions for a formula?
Sentence 149: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: I don't think so.
Sentence 151: They are working on it.
Sentence 152: That's what they are working--it will all be worked out.
Sentence 153: Q. Is it a materially new wage-price stabilization policy, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 154: No, it isn't.
Sentence 155: It's a working out of the situation we are faced with now, and I think it will be worked out in a very satisfactory manner.
Sentence 156: Q.
Sentence 157: Can you say when, sir?
Sentence 158: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 159: I hope in the next day or two.
Sentence 160: Q. There has been some speculation, Mr. President, that this will be called "the big steel formula"?
Sentence 161: THE PRESIDENT [laughing].
Sentence 162: I haven't heard that one.
Sentence 163: Q. Does that mean it will be temporary, Mr. President, in meeting the present situation?
Sentence 164: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 165: Here is the situation that we are trying to meet: We are all aware of the fact that what we need is production.
Sentence 166: We know that if we get production--mass production--on the basis that we are capable of putting out here in this country, that the situation will adjust itself; and whenever that situation comes about there will be no reason for a wage-price formula, for that will adjust itself.
Sentence 167: And that is exactly what we have been working for, ever since V-J Day.
Sentence 168: That was the reason for the first directive on a wage price formula.
Sentence 169: It was my hope that we would, as soon as possible, begin working just as hard as we could to create production to meet the demand that has now piled up as a result of the war.
Sentence 170: We have had some stumbling blocks.
Sentence 171: We are trying to meet those stumbling blocks now.
Sentence 172: The first wage-price formula would have worked, if we had been able to arrive at the production we were hoping we were going to get.
Sentence 173: [5.]
Sentence 174: Q.
Sentence 175: If the steel and other strikes are not settled, will there still be a Florida trip?
Sentence 176: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 177: I am still going to Florida.
Sentence 178: Q.
Sentence 179: [Aside] Good!
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 180: I can still do business by telephone.
Sentence 181: [6.]
Sentence 182: Q. Has the committee from the House Territories Committee reported to you on their investigation of statehood for Hawaii?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 183: That's right.
Sentence 184: They recommended
Q.
Sentence 185: Can you report your views?
Sentence 186: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 187: They recommended that Hawaii ought to have statehood.
Sentence 188: Q.
Sentence 189: As you made in your annual Message for immediate statehood?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 190: That's right.
Sentence 191: I think they were--they are in favor of that very thing.
Sentence 192: Reporter:
Sentence 193: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 194: THE PRESIDENT, All right.
