Sentence 1: 1933 Informal Address Bowdoin Farm

Bowdoin farm is accomplishing something not only for the younger boys and girls, but is also doing something to advance a cause that has long been a pet hobby of mine that is, to educate young men to become useful citizens outside of the cities.
Sentence 2: More and more people are discovering that if they go to live on a farm they will never starve to death, while they may if they remain in the city.
Sentence 3: Of course, in the city they have a chance of becoming millionaires.
Sentence 4: But there are lots of things better than growing exceedingly rich, and one of them is having the assurance of a competence, of a sufficient living, of a good life and good neighbors.
Sentence 5: You boys have a mighty fine chance at that assured life.
