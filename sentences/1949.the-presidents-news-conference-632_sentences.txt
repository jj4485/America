Sentence 22: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 23: I think Mr. Acheson answered that adequately yesterday at his press conference.
Sentence 24: 1
He sent me a copy of what he said, and that covered the situation.
Sentence 25: 1
According to newspaper reports Secretary Acheson declared at his news conference on April 13 that official avenues of communication were still open for Russia if she wanted to discuss lifting the Berlin blockade and undertake four-power talks on Germany, but he made it clear that the blockade must be lifted in advance of general discussions on Germany.
Sentence 26: He made this position known in replying to questions concerning rumors in Europe that the Soviet Union had been extending "feelers" on a solution of the blockade and the German question.
Sentence 27: Mr. Acheson said that the attitude of the United States Government toward the blockade as an obstacle to four-power talks on Germany had been stated many times, both by himself and by his predecessor, Gen. George C. Marshall.
Sentence 28: [4.]
Sentence 29: Q. Mr. President, you were supposed to receive a telegram last week from Representative Lane of Massachusetts, asking you to do something about the unemployment situation in Lawrence.

Sentence 63: The negotiations have not taken place in my office.
Sentence 64: [9.]
Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, have you under consideration any proposals for the Ambassadors to either Paris--either France or Belgium?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: The Secretary of State and I are discussing the appointment of Ambassadors.
Sentence 67: We have come to no firm decision as yet for any of those places.
Sentence 68: Q. What about Moscow, sir?
Sentence 69: Anything you can say about that?

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 103: The St. Lawrence Valley is a different proposition.

Sentence 121: Q. Mr. President, on this alphabet business, what in the devil is Regulation W?

Sentence 124: It requires a certain percentage to be paid down on the purchase, and it was somewhat eased with regard to car purchases not long ago.

Sentence 127: Q. Mr. President, have you been briefed on the speech made in the House yesterday by Representative Cannon on air power?

Sentence 130: Q.
Sentence 131: I thought perhaps you had been briefed on it because it has attracted a great deal of attention?
Sentence 132: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 134: Q.
Sentence 135: You aren't ready to comment on it yet?
Sentence 136: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 139: [18.]
Sentence 140: Q. A $600 million supplemental request for the Veterans Administration came up a couple of days ago--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 141: I think it was $540 million.
Sentence 142: Q.
Sentence 143: I thought it was 595.
Sentence 144: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: Well, whatever it is--we won't quibble over $50 million.
Sentence 146: [Laughter]
Q. I have two questions.
Sentence 147: The first is whether that will increase the prospective deficit by that much?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 148: Certainly it will.
Sentence 149: Q.
Sentence 150: The second question, sir, is whether the same circumstances that prompted that supplemental request will apply on next year's Veterans Administration?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 151: Well, I hope not.
Sentence 152: I hope not.
Sentence 153: I hope that the next time it is necessary to make that estimate, the budget will come more closer to it than it did this time.
Sentence 154: Q.
Sentence 155: You don't plan any supplementals then?
Sentence 156: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 157: Not at the present time, but I can't tell what the conditions will be then.
Sentence 158: 3

On the same day the White House issued the following statement clarifying the effect of the supplemental estimate for the Veterans Administration upon the budget for fiscal year 1949:
"Although the supplemental estimate for readjustment benefits will increase expenditures for this program of the Veterans Administration, its effect upon total expenditures for the fiscal year 1949 must be considered in relation to other Government programs.
Sentence 159: "Out of the $595,890,000 supplemental, $323,193,891 had already been included in the January budget as a supplemental for fiscal year 1949.
Sentence 160: The remaining $272,696,109 thus represents an increase over the original appropriation estimates for readjustment benefits.
Sentence 161: While expenditures for readjustment benefits will thus be somewhat higher than estimated last January, there are offsetting decreases estimated for other programs.
Sentence 162: "A recent review of expenditures indicates that within the total of expenditures some items are now running at a higher rate and others at a lower rate than estimated in January.
Sentence 163: For example, expenditures for ECA and for stockpiling are at a somewhat lower rate than previously estimated, but on the other hand expenditures for veterans' programs and price support are running at a higher rate.
Sentence 164: "These differences, however, almost offset each other and there appear to be no changes of sufficient significance to cause a revision of the January estimate of a $600 million deficit for the fiscal year 1949.
Sentence 165: "
Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 166: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: You're entirely welcome.
