Sentence 2: The Presidents News Conference 408

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: Well, the first thing I want to tell you about is that I called Mr. Hull yesterday, and asked him to go to San Francisco with me for the closing of the conference, whenever that takes place.
Sentence 5: And he said he would like very much to go, but he thought it would be too strenuous a trip to be the first thing he would do after he gets right out of the hospital.
Sentence 6: I wish he could have come.
Sentence 7: I wish he could go.
Sentence 8: [2.]
Sentence 9: I sent down the name of former Governor William H. Wills-W-i-l-1-s--of Vermont to be a member of the Federal Communications Commission.
Sentence 10: He will succeed Norman S. Case, whose term expires on June 30.
Sentence 11: It's just a case of one Republican taking the place of another.
Sentence 12: [Laughter] Vermont is surely a Republican State, so they couldn't accuse me of playing politics up there.
Sentence 13: [Laughter]
Sentence 14: [3.]
Sentence 15: I have another announcement I think I ought to make--it has already been announced--but John Snyder put a draft on Ed McKim to get him away from me for a special job, and I guess I'll have to let him go for the time being.
Sentence 16: Q. Will he go out of the city, sir?
Sentence 17: Wouldn't he leave the city on that job?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 18: No.
Sentence 19: He is going over to the office over here.
Sentence 20: He will probably have to go out of the city for some special reason if Mr. Snyder wants him to, but his headquarters will be here.
Sentence 21: [4.]
Sentence 22: I wanted to say a word about the Office of War Information.
Sentence 23: "In my judgment, the things being done by the Office of War Information need to be done, in the interest of a nation still fighting a war which is far from over, and which the people need to know is far from over.
Sentence 24: OWI's work in both the domestic and the foreign field is now being performed by a trained, integrated, and experienced organization.
Sentence 25: To abolish some of its major functions, while the war is on, would be a mistake.
Sentence 26: It would be equally a mistake to attempt a hurried redistribution of those functions among other agencies which are not now trained or equipped to undertake them.
Sentence 27: "
I am hoping that the Congress will restore the budget estimate for that organization.
Sentence 28: [5.]
Sentence 29: For the parade on the day that we welcome General Eisenbower, I have indicated that the departments and agencies may, in their discretion, permit employees whose services can be spared to leave work without charge of annual leave for such period as may be necessary for the purpose of participating in the city's welcoming of General Eisenhower between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.
I don't think we could do too much to show our appreciation of General Eisenhower.
Sentence 30: That's the reason for that arrangement.
Sentence 31: [6.]
Sentence 32: Now, the thing that you are somewhat interested in, I think, is Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Davies.
Sentence 33: They both returned, and I just want to say a short word as to the background for that, and then you can ask me questions, and I will answer them if I am able to.
Sentence 34: "In order to secure an interchange of views more satisfactorily and quickly than by cable, I sent Mr. Hopkins to Moscow and Mr. Davies to London.
Sentence 35: Their discussions covered the arrangements for the time and place of the meeting of Prime Minister Churchill"
Q. Will you go a little slow, Mr. President ?
Sentence 36: THE PRESIDENT.--"of Prime Minister Churchill, Marshal Stalin, and myself, as to what would be most convenient for all three."
Sentence 37: Ready for me?
Sentence 38: Q. Yes, sir.
Sentence 39: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 40: "Since their return, Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Davies have made their reports to me.
Sentence 41: The results have been completely satisfactory and gratifying.
Sentence 42: "The all important thing which confronts us is that the unity, mutual confidence, and respect which resulted in the military victory should be continued to make secure a just and durable peace.
Sentence 43: "
Q. Can we have that again, please, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: The last paragraph?
Q.
Sentence 45: The all important thing.
Sentence 46: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: "The all important thing which confronts us is that the unity, mutual confidence, and respect which resulted in the military victory should be continued to make secure a just and durable peace.
Sentence 48: "
In other words, Mr. Churchill, Mr. Stalin, and the President of the United States must be able to meet and talk and trust each other, in that we want to believe that each of us wants a just and durable peace.
Sentence 49: That is one of the reasons for the preliminary visits of Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Davies with those two gentlemen.
Sentence 50: Q. Mr. President, has--can you say that a definite time and place has been set for the Big Three meeting?
Sentence 51: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: It has, but I can't announce it, and won't, until we arrive there.
Sentence 53: Q. Mr. President, does the success of these missions extend to other things besides arrangements for the Big Three meeting?
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: Yes.
Sentence 56: Q.
Sentence 57: The Polish situation?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: The Polish situation, yes.
Sentence 59: Q. Have you been advised, sir, that one of the London Poles already has rejected the invitation to Moscow?
1
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 60: No.
Sentence 61: I hadn't heard that.
Sentence 62: 1
On June 12 the White House released a statement listing the representatives of the Polish Provisional Government and Polish democratic leaders in Poland and abroad who had been Invited to Moscow for consultations concerning the reorganization of the Provisional Government of Poland on a broader democratic basis.
Sentence 63: The statement, issued simultaneously in Washington.
Sentence 64: London, and Moscow, is published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 12, p. 1095).
Sentence 65: Q.
Sentence 66: Can you tell us anything about the release of the 16 Poles at that--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: I will.
Sentence 68: That was one of the things that I sent Mr. Hopkins to Moscow for, and conversations were had on that subject.
Sentence 69: No conclusions have as yet been reached, but every effort is being made in behalf of those 16 Poles by both the American Government and the British Government.
Sentence 70: Q. Mr. President, in San Francisco some weeks ago, when the arrest of the Polish leaders was first revealed, the Secretary of State said that negotiations for working on the new government could not proceed until the question of why they were arrested was cleared up.
Sentence 71: Has that position been changed?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 72: That position has been modified, let us say, and I think that we are on a road to a complete settlement; but I want to make no statements that will in any way embarrass the Russian Government.
Sentence 73: Q. Mr. President,--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: At least, we are in a much better position now than we were before Mr. Hopkins went to Moscow, and Mr. Davies went to London.
Sentence 75: Q. Mr. President, did Mr. Pauley's statement on reparations, indicating the very firm American stand of our Government, have any effect on the Russian's position?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: That matter had not been discussed with the Russian Government.
Sentence 77: Q. Mr. President, will Mr. Hopkins go to--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: I don't know what effect it had.
Sentence 79: Q.--the Big Three meeting?
Sentence 80: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: Mr. Pauley set out the position which he was instructed to take when he left here.
Sentence 82: What was your question here?
Sentence 83: Q. Will Mr. Hopkins be going to the Big Three meeting, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: Yes, he will.
Sentence 85: Q. Mr. Byrnes?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 86: Yes.
Sentence 87: Q. Mr. President, do you plan to take
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 88: Admiral Leahy will, also.
Sentence 89: Q. Mr. Davies?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 90: So will Secretary Stettinius.
Sentence 91: Q. Mr. Davies?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: I hadn't talked to Mr. Davies about it until his health permits.
Sentence 93: I may ask him to go.
Sentence 94: He hasn't been well, nor Mr. Hopkins, so that is contingent on both their physical conditions.
Sentence 95: Q. Do you plan to take any congressional leaders to the Big Three--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: I do not.
Sentence 97: Q.
Sentence 98: Who else will go, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 99: I Can't name the others.
Sentence 100: All the Combined Chiefs of Staff will be there, I can say that much.
Sentence 101: Q. Did I understand you to say you won't announce the place until after the arrival there?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 102: Yes, that is correct.
Sentence 103: Q. There is a story this morning that the meeting would be secret, that no newspaper reporters would be permitted--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: That is correct.
Sentence 105: Q.--to be there.
Sentence 106: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: That is correct.
Sentence 108: Q.
Sentence 109: The meeting will be secret?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 110: Well, it will not be public, such as this one is.
Sentence 111: [Laughter] There will be no reporters or press conferences at that meeting.
Sentence 112: Q. Will there be any reporters at the meeting?

Q.
Sentence 119: Do you know what continent it will be held--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: I don't want to answer any questions in regard to that trip.
Sentence 121: Q. Mr. President, has there been any change in American policy which has caused the Russians to change their position on the Polish issue?
Sentence 122: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 123: No.
Sentence 124: There has been no change in the American policy.
Sentence 125: There has been a very pleasant yielding on the part of the Russians to some of the things in which we are interested, and I think if we keep our heads and be patient, we will arrive at a conclusion; because the Russians are just as anxious to get along with us as we are with them.
Sentence 126: And I think they have showed it very conclusively in these last conversations.
Sentence 127: Q. Mr. President, could you tell us what the Russian chief of staff--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 128: Tony,
1
you had better ask Mr. Stalin about that.

Sentence 134: Q. Mr. President, on this no reporters, you will recall that on previous occasions all these meetings have been announced to the world by some sources other than American sources first.
Sentence 135: Have you given any thought to that?
Sentence 136: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 137: That will not be done.
Sentence 138: I think the American reporters will be given an exactly equal chance with all the rest, but these conferences can't be held in the limelight because we are trying to get ready for a peace conference,
Q. Yes, sir.
Sentence 139: THE PRESIDENT.--and that is my objective.
Sentence 140: Q. On other occasions, the news has been diluted by getting out in advance before official
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 163: [8.]
Sentence 164: Q. Mr. President, what was the--what would be the position of the London Polish Government, after the provisional Polish Government is set up as a result of the Moscow conversations?
Sentence 165: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 166: If the Government of Unity, I believe they call it, in Poland is set up and agreed to by the British Government, and the United States Government, and the Russian Government, the London Government will go out of existence.

Q.
Sentence 178: The punishment for the German General Staff?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 179: Well, that matter of punishment will have to be assessed by the trial courts and the prosecutors.
Sentence 180: I am not in a position to say what their punishment should be.
Sentence 181: That would be judging them in advance, and they have not been tried.
Sentence 182: [10.]
Sentence 183: Q. Mr. President, did Mr. Hopkins' work in Russia result directly in a change of the Russian position on the veto question at San Francisco?

Sentence 185: It did.
Sentence 186: Categorically, it did.
Sentence 187: [11.]
Sentence 188: Q. Mr. President, have you any comment at all on the FEPC situation?
Sentence 189: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 191: That is what we are asking.
Sentence 192: [12.]

Sentence 206: [14.]
Sentence 207: Q. What will happen if the London Poles, which were designated to join this Government of Unity, refuse to join it?
Sentence 208: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 209: Well, this is not a government now, and they are being asked to join a conference in Moscow, to set up a government.
Sentence 210: Then, unless they agree, there won't be any government set up.
Sentence 211: So that, I think, answers your question ?
Sentence 212: Q. Mr. President, can we assume that the first act of the new Polish Government of Unity will be to hold a free, democratic election now-with the old formula ?
Sentence 213: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 214: I hope so.

Sentence 216: [15.]
Sentence 217: Q. Mr. President, on several occasions Mr. Grew has deplored the fact that the American newspapers don't get more information by direct reporting within the Russian spheres of influence and occupation.

Sentence 221: Q. Mr. President, you said that if the London people don't go to this conference, in order to help set up a new government, no new government would be set up--

Sentence 224: They're going.
Sentence 225: Don't you worry about that.
Sentence 226: They're going.
Sentence 227: [Laughter]
Q. Do you mean that they have veto power over--England--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 228: No. Don't get this thing tangled up now.
Sentence 229: What we are trying to do is to get the situation worked out that has been causing us a lot of embarrassment.
Sentence 230: And for God's sake, don't you go muddying it all up so as to make it worse!
Sentence 231: We have made arrangements so that all these factions can get together, the present Polish Government, the people in Poland who are not in the Polish Government, and the people in London, to see if they can't sit down and work out a government that will be satisfactory to Poland.
Sentence 232: Now, that's what this conference is for.
Sentence 233: We have succeeded in getting that far.
Sentence 234: But don't upset the applecart.
Sentence 235: Say we have made some progress and that I believe that we can get results that will do what we want, which is a free Polish Government.
Sentence 236: Q. Isn't it true that no member of the present exiled government in London has been invited to go to Moscow for these discussions?
