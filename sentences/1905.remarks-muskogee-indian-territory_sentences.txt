Sentence 1: 1905 Remarks Muskogee Indian Territory

I cannot saw how impressed I have been, traveling through the Territory this morning.
Sentence 2: Your Territory, probably in conjunction with Oklahoma, will soon be one of the great States of this Union.
Sentence 3: I look forward to meeting your Senators and Congressmen not long hence.
Sentence 4: I earnestly hope that as you enter Statehood you will realize the immense responsibility that rests upon you.
Sentence 5: Statehood is a first class thing, if you use it right.
Sentence 6: It will be a mighty poor thing, if you don't.
Sentence 7: Successful self-government, of course, must be based upon the average quality of the citizenship.
Sentence 8: If the average citizen does his duty, you will have a good State, and you will not otherwise.
Sentence 9: Nobody can make a good State except you yourselves.
Sentence 10: You need just the qualities in government that you need in private life.
Sentence 11: A man who is a good neighbor, a good husband, a good father, is the type of man who makes a good citizen.
Sentence 12: The person that you want to have as a neighbor is the man to whom you can tie, on whom you can count, the man who is a game man in time of trouble, but who does not seek trouble, the man who does not brag and brawl, but who makes good; the man who is decent and square in his dealings with others.
Sentence 13: That is just the type you have got to have in public life.
Sentence 14: You cannot afford to let any man represent you in public life if he is crooked.
Sentence 15: I do not care whether he is crooked on your side or not.
Sentence 16: If he will do something that is not exactly straight for your advantage, he will do it quicker for his own advantage.
