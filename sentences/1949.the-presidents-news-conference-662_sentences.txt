THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: Gentlemen, before we start, I have a brief statement I want to make to you.
Sentence 4: [Reading] "At the outset, I do not intend to answer any questions pertaining to the testimony that has been given before Senator Hoey's subcommittee.
Sentence 5: General Vaughan already said that he will go before the committee and make a full statement on all matters with which his name has been connected, and I suggest to you, as the chairman of the committee has done, that you gentlemen and your editors in common fairness suspend judgment on General Vaughan until he has been heard by the committee.

On August 13, the White House released a statement by Maj. Gen. Harry H. Vaughan in which he explained that he had refrained from making any statement concerning the investigation being conducted by the subcommittee under the chairmanship of Senator Hoey, because he had informed the Committee that he would appear as a witness at the proper time and make a full statement regarding all the matters with which his name had been connected.
Sentence 7: But due to recent reports involving the names of prominent persons he thought it best to make a public statement.
Sentence 8: In the release Vaughan stated:
"In 1945 I had a talk with two old friends of mine--Mr. Harry Hoffman and Mr. David Bennett.
Sentence 9: The subject of deep-freeze units came up, and I said that I would like to have one for my house and that I would also like to send one to the Little White House in Independence.
Sentence 10: Mr. Hoffman said that he was associated with a concern that was beginning to manufacture deep-freeze units, and that he thought he could get hold of some factory rejects.
Sentence 11: He asked me whether, if he found that he could obtain some of these units, I would want some for some of my associates.
Sentence 12: "Later Mr. Hoffman informed me that he could obtain some deep-freeze units that did not have commercial market value, as they were experimental models.
Sentence 13: At that time I informed him that I would like to have him send one to me and one to the White House in Washington for the lunch room used by members of the staff.
Sentence 14: Also, I asked him to send one to the Little White House in Independence, Missouri, and to send offer units to Mr. Fred Vinson, Mr. John Snyder, Mr. James K. Vardaman and Mr. Matthew J. Connelly.
Sentence 15: I had previously told them that I was going to get some deep-freeze units and that I would like each of them to have one.
Sentence 16: "It is my recollection that the persons to whom the units were sent were not acquainted with either Mr. Hoffman or Mr. Bennett.
Sentence 17: They may have asked me later from whom I obtained the units and some acknowledgment of the receipt of the units may have been made to these men, or to either of
"The simple explanation of the entire matter is that Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Bennett desired to extend this courtesy to me as a friend, and I in turn made gifts of these units to certain friends of mine.
Sentence 18: "
The hearings held by Senator Hoey's subcommittee are cited in a note to Item 161 [5].
Sentence 19: Now, if you have any questions on any other subject, I will answer them.
Sentence 20: Q. Mr. President, is it mimeographed?
Sentence 21: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 22: No.
Sentence 23: It will not be mimeographed.
Sentence 24: That is a statement from me directly to you.
Sentence 25: Q.
Sentence 26: May we have that quoted, Mr. President?
Sentence 27: Q.
Sentence 28: Can you read it slowly, sir, so that we can get it?
Sentence 29: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 30: Well--[reading]--"At the outset--
Q.
Sentence 31: Just a second, Mr. President, we have a lot of gaps here.
Sentence 32: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: "I want to say to you that I do not intend to answer any questions pertaining to the testimony that has been given before Senator Hoey's subcommittee.
Sentence 34: The principal reason for that is all these committees have been--all these committee hearings have been behind closed doors, and everything that has come out has been leaks.
Sentence 35: [Continuing reading] "General Vaughan has already said that he will go before the committee and make a full statement on all the matters with which his name has been connected--
Q. And make a full statement--
THE PRESIDENT.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: Particularly if they were friendly to Vaughan.
Sentence 64: Q.
Sentence 65: May we quote that, sir?

Sentence 76: I have no one under consideration to take his place, and he will not be replaced.
Sentence 77: That is about as emphatic as I can make it.

Sentence 89: [4.]
Sentence 90: Q. Mr. President, have you any comment on the Housing Expediter's decision to decontrol one-third of the rent control--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: The only comment that I have to make is that the Congress did not appropriate enough money to enforce the rent control law, and all the Expediter can do is to use as much money as the Congress gave him.
Sentence 92: That's the only thing--that's all the trouble.
Sentence 93: We suggested to the Congress that they give him more money.
Sentence 94: There was more money in the budget for that purpose.

Sentence 116: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: If Senator George will find a source of revenue to keep the Government running, why then I have no objection to his reorganization of the tax structure.
Sentence 118: But the Government must have revenue to run.
Sentence 119: There has been a lot of yelling now about deficit financing, but so long as 80 percent of the budget is a fixed charge, and that budget has to run on that fixed charge, we have got to find the money to run it.

Sentence 138: [12.]
Sentence 139: Q. Mr. President, I am sorry to revert back to the Vaughan thing, but there is going to be one question that is inevitably going to come up, when your statement comes up, and that is where the White House lays the blame or the responsibility for the fact that those sessions that were favorable to General Vaughan were closed sessions.
