Sentence 1: 1930 The Presidents News Conference 747

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I would like to have a little more inspiration from your side on things I can talk about.
Sentence 3: APPOINTMENTS
I have only two questions--regarding the Tariff Commission and the Power Commission.
Sentence 4: There will be some changes in the personnel of the Tariff Commission, and the whole Power Commission, of course, is to be appointed.
Sentence 5: And I am in hopes of being able to have all those changes in front of the Senate before they finally leave Washington.
Sentence 6: So I am rather short of material to discuss at the present moment.
Sentence 7: Q. Could you indicate, Mr. President, how extensive the changes in the Tariff Commission will be ?
Sentence 8: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 9: I haven't decided that yet.
Sentence 10: We will have some changes, but I haven't decided what they will be.
Sentence 11: Q. About the sailfish, Mr. President, is that something new ?
Sentence 12: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 13: That just came in brand new.
Sentence 14: It is an unpleasant reminder of pleasant things.
