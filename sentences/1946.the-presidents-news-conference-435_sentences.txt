THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: Reiteration of the policy toward China was released today.
Sentence 4: I think you have all had it.
Sentence 5: [2.]
Sentence 6: And also, the Economic Council's Report to me was released to you.
Sentence 7: 1
1
The First Report of the Council of Economic Advisers is printed in Senate Document 6 (80th Cong., 1st sess.).
Sentence 8: I have no special announcements to make.
Sentence 9: If anybody has any questions--
[3.]
Sentence 10: Q. Mr. President, was there any reason for the timing of the Chinese announcement ?
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 12: Not that I know of.
Sentence 13: Q.
Sentence 14: What was the purpose of it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 15: So the people would know what our policy toward China is.
Sentence 16: Q.
Sentence 17: You mean American people?
Sentence 18: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 19: Yes.
Sentence 20: [4.]
Sentence 21: Q. Mr. President, I have a specific question, sir, on the Economic Council's Report.
Sentence 22: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 23: Shoot.
Sentence 24: Q.
Sentence 25: I see Dr. Nourse is here.
Sentence 26: I am very curious, sir, as to why the figure of approximately 1,500,000 electrical refrigerators and ranges--washing machines, rather, was used as a symbol for what would be good in 1947 and 1948, since the revised Commerce Department figure shows that in one instance it was better in 1939 and the other almost as good, which certainly was not a full employment year.
Sentence 27: Have you had any information on that, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 28: No, I have these economists to make that report to me for that purpose, and I haven't studied the report carefully.
Sentence 29: Maybe Dr. Nourse would want to answer that question?
Sentence 30: Dr. Nourse: I don't think that the report said that.
Sentence 31: I thought it said "and similar figures" after speaking of housing as to those electrical appliances.
Sentence 32: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: Read the report carefully.
Sentence 34: I don't think it has any wild statements.
Sentence 35: [Laughter]
Sentence 36: [5.]
Sentence 37: Q. Mr. President, to go back to your Chinese statement, at the time that you sent General Marshall over, I believe you said fairly carefully that he would stay a matter of months, and it has now been just over a year; and I wonder if you expect that he will continue--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: One year is 12 months.
Sentence 39: That statement was made the 15th of December last year--1945.
Sentence 40: This reiterates a clarification of the situation as it has developed.
Sentence 41: General Marshall will stay as long as it is necessary with the hope of getting the thing settled.
Sentence 42: [6.]
Sentence 43: Q. Mr. President, on the Economic Council's Report
Sentence 44: [7.]
Sentence 45: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 46: General Marshall has done a remarkable job.
Sentence 47: Nobody could have done better.
Sentence 48: [8.] Go ahead with your Economic Council--
Q.
Sentence 49: In view of the possibility of a recession in 1947 and--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 50: What makes you think there's a possibility of a recession in 1947?
Sentence 51: I don't admit to any such thing.
Sentence 52: Q.
Sentence 53: The report suggests that there are factors which might bring about one.
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: Well, I haven't carefully read the report, but I don't agree with any such suggestions.
Sentence 56: Q. Mr. President, will your report to Congress be more specific than this report?
Sentence 57: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: Yes.
Sentence 59: Q.
Sentence 60: You will have more concrete proposals?
Sentence 61: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 62: Yes.
Sentence 63: My report will be a concrete report.
Sentence 64: Q.
Sentence 65: You will have a report--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: I will discuss it with you just like I will the budget.
Sentence 67: Q. Will it contain legislation--
Q. Contain recommendations?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 68: Yes.
Sentence 69: Q.
Sentence 70: This one was very vague.
Sentence 71: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 72: It will contain specific recommendations.
Sentence 73: Q. Mr. President, some of the discussed implications of this report are that not very much in the way of legislation seemed to be necessary for next year.
Sentence 74: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 75: I am very glad to hear that.
Sentence 76: [Laughter]
Sentence 77: [9.]
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, can--I have one more question about China.
Sentence 79: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 80: Sure.
Sentence 81: Q.
Sentence 82: In your statement you said that we started--that we have continued this policy.
Sentence 83: You mean the point that while we haven't attained the objective which we sought and which we are still seeking, would it be correct to assume that this policy is permanent--
Sentence 84: I mean by that until that objective is attained?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 85: This policy is a continuing policy, that's the reason I reiterate it.
Sentence 86: [10.]
Sentence 87: Q. Mr. President, would you care to say what you think the outlook for 1947 is, in an economic way?
Sentence 88: Voices: Can't hear--can't hear.
Sentence 89: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 90: He wants to know what, in my opinion, the economic outlook for 1947 is.
Sentence 91: Well, I think I made the statement time and again that the outlook for the country is good, and it will continue to be good if we can just get people to go to work.
Sentence 92: I have reiterated that ever since my speech in Kentucky, at the dedication of that dam.
Sentence 93: [11.]
Sentence 94: Q. Mr. President, getting back to China--is that 500 million dollar import credit endangered by the present statement?
Sentence 95: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: The 500 million import, I hope, is not endangered.
Sentence 97: Q.
Sentence 98: You hope it is not?
Sentence 99: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: I don't want to make a positive statement on it.
Sentence 101: [12.]
Sentence 102: Q. Mr. President, when you say "go to work," I think the original was made during a strike.
Sentence 103: Do you mean to say now that we have to go to work or keep on working
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: Stay at work.
Sentence 105: Q.
Sentence 106: You don't want any strikes in 1947?
Sentence 107: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: Nobody wants any strikes.
Sentence 109: I never want any strikes at all, and I don't think any of them were necessary.
Sentence 110: Q. Mr. President, can you say anything about your specific recommendations to Congress ?
Sentence 111: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 112: No. I will give you that when I get ready to make it.
Sentence 113: Q. Mr. President, yesterday Mr. Stassen posed the problem of clarifying the national labor policy as prior to and more immediate than the problem of housing.
Sentence 114: Do you share that view ?

Sentence 116: I will set that out in clear and understandable terms in the Message on the State of the Union.
Sentence 117: [13.]

Sentence 131: When I get ready to send out the documents to Congress--my reports to the Congress--I will see that you are fully informed.
Sentence 132: [15.]
Sentence 133: Q. Senator Vandenberg suggested yesterday that he would like certain areas of bipartisan agreement on foreign policy--to cover all phases of international relations.
Sentence 134: Have you given that any thought?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 135: Yes.
Sentence 136: We have always had that in mind.
Sentence 137: When we say bipartisan policy in international relations that covers the whole field.
Sentence 138: We have been trying to adhere to that policy right straight through.
Sentence 139: Q.
Sentence 140: He mentions specifically that there have been no bipartisan conversations on things like Argentina and the Far East-Palestine.
Sentence 141: THE PRESIDENT.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 187: Well of course, it will be based--the budget itself will be based on law.
Sentence 188: You make certain recommendations in the budget which are not a part of it until they become the law, if you want to make a hairline distinction on it.
Sentence 189: [22.]
Sentence 190: Q. Mr. President, would you care to comment on the suggestion by Senators Murray and Flanders that the work we have been doing in China be extended by the establishment of a three-nation board--the Soviet Union, Britain, and United States ?
