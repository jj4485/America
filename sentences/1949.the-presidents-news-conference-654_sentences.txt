Sentence 157: "
Upon being informed of the report Secretary of the Army Gordon Gray stated on June 9, 1949, that the Army had never investigated Mr. Clapp and "had absolutely no derogatory information about him which would warrant his not being employed by the Army for security or any other reasons.
Sentence 158: "
A statement to the press by the National Military Establishment added that examination of its files, including those of the Army General Staff's Military Intelligence Division, "shows nothing reflecting on Mr. Clapp which, in any way, would cause the Department of the Army to question his loyalty or employability under Military Intelligence standards of security or for any other reason.
Sentence 159: "
The word "unemployable," the statement explained, was used as a result of "an unreviewed action by a junior officer, acting upon a request for personnel received from Military Government in Germany."

Sentence 170: No.
Sentence 171: I have no comment on that particular statement, but as soon as the reorganization bill is passed, we will proceed with the reorganization plans as fast as we can get them ready.

Sentence 173: I asked for the extension of that reorganization law, and the Both Congress refused to make that extension.

Sentence 196: It isn't for me to clear up.
Sentence 197: Q.

7

Sentence 215: 7

Sentence 219: Q. Have you any thought of that
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 220: No, no.
Sentence 221: None at all.
Sentence 222: Q. Well, Mr. President, do you think that would be a good thing to let out of the files unsubstantiated allegations that people are reds, subversives, and things like that?

Sentence 224: No comment on that.
Sentence 225: Q. Mr. President, did Attorney General Clark take the matter of this difference of opinion between Mr. Condon and Mr. Hoover
