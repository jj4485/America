Sentence 1: 1864 Remarks Response Serenade

I am notified that this is a compliment paid me by the loyal Marylanders, resident in this District.
Sentence 2: I infer that the adoption of the new constitution for the State, furnishes the occasion; and that, in your view, the extirpation of slavery constitutes the chief merit of the new constitution.
Sentence 3: Most heartily do I congratulate you, and Maryland, and the nation, and the world, upon the event.
Sentence 4: I regret that it did not occur two years sooner, which I am sure would have saved to the nation more money than would have met all the private loss incident to the measure.
Sentence 5: But it has come at last, and I sincerely hope it's friends may fully realize all their anticipations of good from it; and that it's opponents may, by it's effects, be agreeably and profitably, disappointed.
Sentence 6: A word upon another subject.
Sentence 7: Something said by the Secretary of State in his recent speech at Auburn, has been construed by some into a threat that, if I shall be beaten at the election, I will, between then and the end of my constitutional term, do what I may be able, to ruin the government.
Sentence 8: Others regard the fact that the Chicago Convention adjourned, not sine die, but to meet again, if called to do so by a particular individual, as the intimation of a purpose that if their nominee shall be elected, he will at once seize control of the government.
Sentence 9: I hope the good people will permit themselves to suffer no uneasiness on either point.
Sentence 10: I am struggling to maintain government, not to overthrow it.
Sentence 11: I am struggling especially to prevent others from overthrowing it.
Sentence 12: I therefore say, that if I shall live, I shall remain President until the fourth of next March; and that whoever shall be constitutionally elected therefor in November, shall be duly installed as President on the fourth of March; and that in the interval I shall do my utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for the next voyage, shall start with the best possible chance to save the ship.
Sentence 13: This is due to the people both on principle, and under the constitution.
Sentence 14: Their will, constitutionally expressed, is the ultimate law for all.
Sentence 15: If they should deliberately resolve to have immediate peace even at the loss of their country, and their liberty, I know not the power or the right to resist them.
Sentence 16: It is their own business, and they must do as they please with their own.
Sentence 17: I believe, however, they are still resolved to preserve their country and their liberty; and in this, in office or out of it, I am resolved to stand by them.
Sentence 18: I may add that in this purpose to save the country and it's liberties, no classes of people seem so nearly unanamous as the soldiers in the field and the seamen afloat.
Sentence 19: Do they not have the hardest of it?
Sentence 20: Who should quail while they do not?
Sentence 21: God bless the soldiers and seamen, with all their brave commanders.
