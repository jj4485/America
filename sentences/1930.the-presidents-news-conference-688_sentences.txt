Sentence 1: 1930 The Presidents News Conference 688

NOMINATION OF A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: As you probably already know, I have sent the name of Circuit Judge John J. Parker of North Carolina to the Senate for the Associate Judgeship in Justice Sanford's place.
Sentence 3: 1
1
Edward T. Sanford was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1923 to his death on March 8, 1930.
Sentence 4: The nomination of Judge Parker was strongly opposed by labor organizations and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Sentence 5: On April 9, 1930, the White House released a Justice Department memorandum as an answer to criticism by opposing factions.
Sentence 6: The Senate Judiciary Committee reported the nomination adversely, and on May 7, the Senate rejected it by a vote of 41 to 39.
Sentence 7: Although fitness is, of course, the primary requisite for selection to the Supreme Court, it is interesting to note that that particular circuit has not been represented in the Court for 70 years.
Sentence 8: All the other circuits have been represented during the last 20 years except that circuit.
Sentence 9: The original setup of the Court was presumably, although not necessarily, based on a distribution amongst the different circuits, and at least this selection has the interesting point to it that it does meet the geographic question a little better than the selections hitherto proposed.
Sentence 10: Q.
Sentence 11: What circuit is it, Mr. President ?
Sentence 12: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 13: The fourth.
Sentence 14: Q. Mr. President, do you mean that every section of the country except that has been represented on the Court in the last 70 years ?

Sentence 16: In the last 20 years.
Sentence 17: The circuit longest without a justice is the fourth--70 years without a justice.
Sentence 18: Q.
Sentence 19: Who was the last from that circuit, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 20: I can even tell you that.
Sentence 21: [Peter V.] Daniel, retired in 1860.
Sentence 22: The seventh circuit--that is, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin--has been 20 years without a justice.
Sentence 23: The fifth circuit--Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi--has been without one since [Chief] Justice
Sentence 24: [Edward D.] White died in 1921.
Sentence 25: The third circuit--Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey--has been 8 years without a justice.
Sentence 26: Q. Mr. President, are you following your usual practice to give out the endorsements in this case ?
Sentence 27: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 28: I don't think so.
Sentence 29: I may say that they are very extensive and embrace very large sections of the judiciary as well as the laity of lawyers.
Sentence 30: THE HAITIAN COMMISSION
The Haitian Commission was here for preliminary report.
Sentence 31: They will be engaged during the next week in making out their final report and recommendations.
Sentence 32: That report will cover the steps that they recommend to be taken in the gradual establishment of self-government in Haiti sequent to the steps that have already been taken.
Sentence 33: As you know from the press, they have arranged for a temporary neutral president, who takes office on the 15th of May, to be followed later by an election of their Congress.
Sentence 34: That Congress in turn elects a president, and the Commission is now engaged on formulating those steps to be taken subsequent to that time.
Sentence 35: They hope to have their report ready at the end of the week.
Sentence 36: WITHDRAWAL OF MARINES FROM NICARAGUA
We have arranged, also, today to withdraw further marines from Nicaragua.
Sentence 37: We will reduce the force there to somewhere between 900 and 1,000.
Sentence 38: This means the withdrawal of some 750 to 850, it being one of the sequent steps to withdrawing from that country.
Sentence 39: And that is all that I have on this occasion.
