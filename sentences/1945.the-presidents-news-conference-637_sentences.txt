Sentence 2: The Presidents News Conference 637

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: I want to make a statement in connection with the fact finding boards, and this will be available in mimeographed form when you go out.
Sentence 5: [Reading] "In appointing a fact finding board in an industrial dispute where one of the questions at issue is wages, it is essential to a fulfillment of its duty that the board have the authority, whenever it deems it necessary, to examine the books of the employer.
Sentence 6: That authority is essential to enable the board to determine the ability of the employer to pay an increase in wages where such ability is in question.
Sentence 7: Ability to pay is always one of the facts relevant to the issue of an increase in wages.
Sentence 8: "This does not mean that the Government or its fact finding board is going to endeavor to fix a rate of return for the employer.
Sentence 9: It does mean, however, that since wages are paid out of earnings, the question of earnings is relevant.
Sentence 10: "The detailed information, obtained from the books of an employer should not be made public.
Sentence 11: Such a disclosure would place the employer at a disadvantage with respect to his competitors.
Sentence 12: But the fact finding board should unquestionably have the right to examine the employer's books where it deems it necessary in order to make up its own mind as to whether a demand for an increase is justified, and to make public all findings based on such information, that it deems relevant to the controversy.
Sentence 13: "That is one of the things I meant when I stated in my message of December 3, 1945, to Congress, and I quote:
"'The Board should be . . .
Sentence 14: directed to make a thorough investigation of all the facts which it deems relevant in the controversy.'
Sentence 15: "This is nothing new.
Sentence 16: There are many instances where the books of corporations are opened for inspection to representatives of the State and Federal Governments and where the information so obtained is used solely by such officials to carry out their functions.
Sentence 17: "To confer the right to examine books is one of the main purposes of granting subpoena power to the fact finding boards.
Sentence 18: I trust that the Congress, which is the only body authorized to grant such power, will do so quickly.
Sentence 19: "In view of the public interest involved, it would be highly unfortunate if any party to a dispute should refuse to cooperate with a fact finding board."
Sentence 20: [2.]
Sentence 21: Now, I am going to have for release for you the letter which I sent today--identical letters to Senator Wagner and Representative Carter Manasco, in regard to the full employment bill, which is in conference--those two gentlemen are the Chairmen of the House and Senate conferees--calling attention to the fact that the Senate bill more nearly complies with the message which was sent to the Congress, and expressing the hope that the Senate bill will be adopted by the conferees.
Sentence 22: The release will speak for itself.
Sentence 23: 1

See Item 222.
Sentence 24: I also want to say while--in that same connection, that I am highly appreciative of the sincere efforts that a large number of Congressmen and Senators put forth in an endeavor to get a full employment bill on the books.
Sentence 25: Now then, I am ready for questions.
Sentence 26: [3.]
Sentence 27: Q. Mr. President, oftentimes when you talk about opening up the books of employers, there is a counterproposal made that the unions' books should be opened up.
Sentence 28: Is there anything you could tell us as to your views on that?
Sentence 29: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 30: I think that power applies to everything that is relevant with regard to wages and prices.
Sentence 31: [4.]
Sentence 32: Q. Mr. President, when would you send the message to Congress on the British loan?
Sentence 33: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 34: As soon as the State Department has the thing in shape to send down.
Sentence 35: I told the people who are interested in that, that the .message would not go down until after the holidays.
Sentence 36: [5'] Q. Mr. President, some people in the Navy seem to think that part of the unification message was intended to muzzle naval officers, and to stop further discussion by them of the whole question of unification.
Sentence 37: Was that your intention?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: No such intention in view.
Sentence 39: There has never been any attempt to muzzle anybody.
Sentence 40: I want everybody to express his honest opinion on the subject, and I want to get the best results that are possible.
Sentence 41: In order to do that, I want the opinions of everybody.
Sentence 42: And nobody has been muzzled.
Sentence 43: It will be necessary now, though, for all people who are in the services, to make a statement that they are expressing their personal views and not the views of the administration.
Sentence 44: I have expressed those views myself.
Sentence 45: [6.]
Sentence 46: Q. Mr. President, have you decided what action you are going to have on the congressional bill returning the employment services to the States?
Sentence 47: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 50: [7.]
Sentence 51: Q. Mr. President, a broadcaster out of Japan today made the assertion that General MacArthur has threatened to resign--is upset about the possibility that Russia might have a part in the occupation of Japan.

Sentence 54: Q. About such a statement?

Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, there is a report from London that the British Navy rather than the American Navy broke the Japanese code, and the Navy says that anything on that report would have to come from the White House rather than from the Navy Department.

Sentence 78: [12.]

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: Anything.
Sentence 92: Q. There has been talk that the operators--manufacturers--General Motors might walk out of the fact finding board, if the pressure were put on for its books at that time, and we couldn't expect anything further until congressional action?
