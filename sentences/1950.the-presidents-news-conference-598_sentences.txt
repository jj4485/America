Sentence 5: Q. Mr. President, having in mind the invitation from the President of Chile earlier in the year, is there any possibility that you would visit Chile the latter part of this year?
Sentence 6: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 7: Not with a special session of Congress going on.
Sentence 8: I can't go anywhere.
Sentence 9: [2.]
Sentence 10: Q. Mr. President, are you now in complete agreement with General MacArthur on Formosa?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 11: Let me tell you something that will be good for your soul.
Sentence 12: It's a pity that you columnists and reporters that represent a certain press service can't understand the ideas of two intellectually honest men when they meet.
Sentence 13: General MacArthur is the commander in chief of the Far East.
Sentence 14: He is a member of the Government of the United States.
Sentence 15: He is loyal to that Government.
Sentence 16: He is loyal to the President.
Sentence 17: He is loyal to the President in his foreign policy, which I hope a lot of your papers were--wish a lot of your papers were.
Sentence 18: There is no disagreement between General MacArthur and myself.
Sentence 19: It was a most successful conference.
Sentence 20: Formosa was settled a month ago, or 5 weeks, I think it was.
Sentence 21: And there was nothing about Formosa to be settled with General MacArthur.
Sentence 22: I went out there to get General MacArthur's viewpoint on Japan and the Japanese treaty, to find out if he had any suggestions to make to the treaty which we had drawn and sent around for discussion.
Sentence 23: I went out there to find out about the rehabilitation of Korea, and I found out about it.
Sentence 24: And we have made a decision on what we are going to do about it.
Sentence 25: We talked about all the rest of the Asiatic Continent and the Far East, and when General MacArthur went to leave, he said that it was one of the most successful conferences he had ever attended.
Sentence 26: And I said the same thing.
Sentence 27: There's your answer.
Sentence 28: Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 29: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 30: You understand now, don't you?

Sentence 37: Q.
Sentence 38: The Philippines.
Sentence 39: Q. Mr. President, I hate to bring up Formosa again--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 40: Formosa is answered, and I have nothing to say further on it.
Sentence 41: Q.
Sentence 42: No more comment?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 43: No more comment whatever.
Sentence 44: I answered you on that.
Sentence 45: Q. Mr. President, did you discuss the admission of Red China to the United Nations?
Sentence 46: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: Did not.
Sentence 48: Did not.
Sentence 49: Q.
Sentence 50: What was that question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 51: He wanted to know if we discussed the admission of Red China to the United Nations, and I said I did not discuss that.
Sentence 52: Q. Mr. President, not discussing Formosa in connection with the conference, but I wonder if I could ask this question?
Sentence 53: Do you intend to actually defend Formosa pending a disposition of it by the United Nations?
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: We have no reason to consider that question because that is a river that we have not come to as yet.
Sentence 56: [Pause]
[3.]
Sentence 57: Q. I will ask one, Mr. President.
Sentence 58: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 59: All right.
Q. On Monday, the Genocide Convention became effective because, I think, there are five other countries that have ratified it, and we haven't yet.
Sentence 60: I wonder if you would urge the Senate to--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 61: One of the last things I did before the Congress adjourned was to urge the Senate to ratify that convention;
1
and of course, when they come back here, I am going to urge them again to ratify it as promptly as it is possible.
Sentence 62: It will be ratified.
Sentence 63: 1 See Item 222.
Sentence 64: [4.]
Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, would you care to comment on the action taken by the United Nations in approving the Acheson proposal for closer unity among the United Nations?

Sentence 67: I am very well satisfied with it, and I think I made that clear in my San Francisco speech.
Sentence 68: 2
2
See Item 269.
Sentence 69: [5.]
Sentence 70: Q. Mr. President, is there any possibility that members of the Reserve will get the idea sometime in the near future of what their status is as regards service?
Sentence 71: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 72: We have been discussing that with the Defense Department, and I hope that we can work out a program that will be equitable and fair, both to the Reserves and to the citizen soldiers altogether.
Sentence 73: [6.]
Sentence 74: Q. Mr. President, Senator Pat McCarran said awhile ago that your administration is trying to discredit the anti-Communist bill by this action today on Spain?
3
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 75: The administration did not discredit the law.
Sentence 76: The law was discredited in the Congress.
Sentence 77: All I am doing is enforcing it, and I expect to enforce it to the letter.
Sentence 78: 3
Sentence 79: On October 19 the Department of Justice ordered members of the Spanish Falangist Party barred from the United States, ruling that they were totalitarians inadmissible under the terms of the new Internal Security Act.
Sentence 80: The Department of State, acting simultaneously, instructed its officials abroad to suspend action on visas held or applied for by Falange members until a governmental study of the new law could be completed.
Sentence 81: Q.
Sentence 82: What was that question on, please?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 83: On Senator McCarran's anti-Communist bill, or pro-Communist bill, I call it.
Sentence 84: [Laughter]
Sentence 85: [7.]
Sentence 86: Q. Mr. President, I have a "must" question--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: Sure--[laughter]--I am not exasperated with you, you can ask me anything you want, but I don't think I want to comment any further on questions about Formosa.
Sentence 88: It is not necessary.
Sentence 89: But I will try to answer your question.
Sentence 90: Q.
Sentence 91: It is not on Formosa.
Sentence 92: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 93: That's all right.
Sentence 94: Q.
Sentence 95: In view of the protests by Southern Congressmen and the cotton bloc, do you feel that the 2 million bales cotton export quota should be relaxed ?
Sentence 96: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: I didn't get the beginning of your question.
Sentence 98: Q.
Sentence 99: The 2 million bale quota on cotton exports, which some Southern Congressmen have protested--the question was whether you felt that--do you know of any justification for relaxing it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: No, there is no justification for relaxing it, because we need the cotton here at home.
Sentence 101: That's the reason the quota was put on.
Sentence 102: [8.]
Sentence 103: Q. Mr. President, in connection with the Reserve thing, have you any ideas when the program will be announced?
Sentence 104: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 105: No, I haven't.
Sentence 106: You see what the difficulty is that those men who accepted Reserve commissions, and those enlisted men who stayed in the organized Reserve, and those who joined the National Guard and helped to reorganize it are to some extent making some sacrifice for their country over those who have come of age in the last 5 years to render military service.
Sentence 107: And it is not exactly fair.
Sentence 108: I don't know how we are going to work it out, but the Defense Department is working on it.
Sentence 109: That is what the difficulty is.
Sentence 110: And a lot of Reservists have been discharged from their jobs.
Sentence 111: I think that is certainly a patriotic thing for people to do!
Sentence 112: Those are the fellows that ought to have the pick of the jobs.
Sentence 113: Q.
Sentence 114: What was the last part of your sentence ?
Sentence 115: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 116: I said that some of those Reservists are being discharged because they are Reservists, and that certainly is a highly patriotic thing to do.
Sentence 117: Those fellows ought to have priority on everything of that kind.
Sentence 118: [9.]
Sentence 119: Q. Mr. President, can you give us an idea when the Bell report on the Philippines might be made public?
4
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: It will be some time before it is made public, if it ever is.
Sentence 121: 4
See Items 180 and 238 [5].
Sentence 122: [10.]
Sentence 123: Q. Mr. President, do you feel more optimistic concerning the Democrats' prospects in the New York elections?
Sentence 124: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 125: I think the Democrats are going to have a landslide this fall.
Sentence 126: I think there are going to be a lot of surprised Republicans, just as there were in 1948.
Sentence 127: Q. May I ask--
Q.
Sentence 128: Do you think
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 129: What?
Sentence 130: [Laughter]
Q. Go ahead.
Sentence 131: Q.
Sentence 132: This is politics.
Sentence 133: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 134: Go ahead--go ahead.
Sentence 135: Q.
Sentence 136: So is mine.
Sentence 137: [More laughter]
Q. Does that landslide in New York have anything to do with a certain letter
5
which is being talked about up there?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 138: I read that letter, and I was sorry I read it, and sorry a thing of that kind had to come up before the public.
Sentence 139: And I have no comment to make on it at all.
Sentence 140: I think, of course, that it will have some effect on the New York elections, and it won't hurt the Democrats.
Sentence 141: 5 On September 5, 1950, Lt. Governor Joe R. Hanley of New York sent a letter to Representative W. Kingsland Macy in which he indicated that he had agreed to run for the Senate on the Republican ticket as a result of "unalterable and unquestionably definite propositions" made to him during a conference with Governor Thomas E. Dewey.
Sentence 142: The full text of the letter is printed in the Congressional Record (vol. 96, p. A7635).
Sentence 143: [11.]
Sentence 144: Q. I was going to ask if you expect the landslide to extend into Pennsylvania, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: Oh, I can't prophesy on that.
Sentence 146: I am trying to increase membership in the House and the Senate.
Sentence 147: They have always said we were going to lose some States, but I don't think so.
Sentence 148: I can't comment on specific States because I don't know the local conditions.
Sentence 149: I hope we elect Frank Myers,
6
though.
Sentence 150: 6
Senator Francis J. Myers of Pennsylvania.
Sentence 151: Q.
Sentence 152: Do you think, sir, there will be increases in both Chambers?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 154: Q. Mr. President, Senator Anderson this morning left the door open just a smidge for you to go out campaigning?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 155: I have no plans in that direction.
Sentence 156: [12.]
Sentence 157: Q. Mr. President, any chance of your going home to vote?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 158: Yes, I think I will go home to vote, if everything is all right here so I can leave.
Sentence 159: Q. Might say a few words the night before the election?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 160: No.
Sentence 161: I am going to receive and dedicate a bell out there that was given to Independence by a little village in France where these Liberty Bells were cast.
Sentence 162: That will be the Monday of the week, and go in the daytime.
Sentence 163: 7
7
See Item 281.
Sentence 164: Q. Is that down home?
Sentence 165: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 166: This is cast in Independence.
Sentence 167: Q.
Sentence 168: Do they know out home that you are coming?
Sentence 169: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 170: Oh yes, they have made arrangements for it.
Sentence 171: Q. I have been out of town.
Sentence 172: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 173: That's one on me that I can't answer.
Sentence 174: [Laughter]
Sentence 175: [13.]
Sentence 176: Q. Mr. President, Senator Martin of Pennsylvania, in a campaign speech last night, said that the President was delaying putting in price and wage controls until after the election for political--
THE PRESIDENT, No, the Senator is very much mistaken about that.
Sentence 177: I am sure that Senator Martin would not make a statement of that kind with vicious intent.
Sentence 178: He is a fine gentleman.
Sentence 179: Every effort has been made to get these things done as rapidly as possible, but you know, one of the difficulties-since a man has to have his character assassinated and have his private life hung out on the public line, I want to get men to fill those places that are the kind you want.
Sentence 180: [14.]
Sentence 181: Q. Mr. President, did any question of General MacArthur's resignation arise?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: No.
Sentence 183: No.
Sentence 184: I had no intention of it arising.
Sentence 185: He told me very specifically that he was happy in his job, and he wanted to finish it.

Sentence 187: Q. Mr. President, did he indicate when he might come back here for a visit?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 188: No.
Sentence 189: He did not want to come back until his job is finished, he said.
Sentence 190: I imagine he meant the Japanese treaty, when he said that.
Sentence 191: Q. Did he indicate how long--do you know how long that might be?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 192: No, I can't tell you how long it is going to take to negotiate that Jap treaty.
Sentence 193: I hope it will be done promptly.
Sentence 194: [15.]
Sentence 195: Q. Do you have any appointment in mind for Senator Graham?

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 196: Senator Graham has informed me that he wants to finish his term as Senator, and then he would be willing to talk to me.
