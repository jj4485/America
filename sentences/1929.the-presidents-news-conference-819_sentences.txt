Sentence 1: 1929 The Presidents News Conference 819

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I haven't a single question from the press this morning.
Sentence 3: Apparently you have no curiosity whatever.
Sentence 4: So I don't know that I have any starting point for a discussion.
Sentence 5: WILLIAM A. DEGROOT
Sentence 6: I had an inquiry from one member of the press yesterday with regard to Mr. DeGroot in New York.
Sentence 7: I haven't yet received a report from the Attorney General on that subject, and therefore I haven't anything that I can add to it.
Sentence 8: THE ROLE OF THE PRESS IN NEWS CONFERENCES
Sentence 9: But I think you will have to take a part of this labor upon yourselves and indicate some directions in which you would like a little information.
Sentence 10: A press conference is a conference that works both ways, and I do not know that I can stand up here and deliver orations or essays or mandates or anything of that kind unless I have some suggestions from your side.
Sentence 11: So that is all I have on my mind today, I am sorry to say.
