Sentence 1: 1947 The Presidents News Conference 384

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: Well, I am glad to see you this morning.
Sentence 4: Just 2 years ago I called you in here at 8:30 in the morning and made an announcement that the Germans had surrendered officially, and read you two proclamations, I think, one calling for a day of prayer the following Sunday, and one outlining the necessity for continued work until the Japanese had surrendered.
Sentence 5: There was a grand rush, after that announcement was made, and Merriman Smith broke his arm as he went out the door, and another fellow here
1
who broke his leg, almost but not quite.
Sentence 6: 1
Robert G. Nixon of the International News Service.
Sentence 7: Q. Not quite, Mr. President.
Sentence 8: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 9: So I hope there won't be any occasion for such a tremendous rush this morning.
Sentence 10: A great many things have happened during that period that have been interesting and we hope constructive.
Sentence 11: The outlook now, from my viewpoint, is much improved to what it was then.
Sentence 12: I am still an optimist that we will eventually get a peace which will be lasting, and that the United Nations will effectually carry out its Charter.
Sentence 13: I am as sure of that as I am standing here.
Sentence 14: At that time, we were still working on the United Nations Charter.
Sentence 15: It was my privilege after that to go and speak to the windup of that conference on the writing of the United Nations Charter.
Sentence 16: A short time after that I went to Potsdam and spent several weeks there.
Sentence 17: A great many of you were with me on that trip.
Sentence 18: And then on August 14th
Sentence 19: the Japanese folded up.
Sentence 20: Both the end of the war with Germany and the war with Japan were ahead of the anticipated schedule--left us with a great many problems, particularly Some 12,800,000 men under arms, whose mothers and fathers immediately wanted them discharged the next day--which couldn't be done.
Sentence 21: We got over that hump in very good shape, and I think successfully got over most of the others that we have had to meet.
Sentence 22: We still have a great many to meet, and we're still expecting to meet them successfully, for the welfare of the United States.
Sentence 23: I didn't intend to make you a speech, but I thought you ought to be reminded that this is just the second birthday of the windup of the war with Germany, and still have 3 months to go for 2 years after the Japanese folded up.
Sentence 24: Now I would be willing to answer any questions I can.
Sentence 25: [2.]
Sentence 26: Q. Mr. President, how old do you feel today, in view of all that?
