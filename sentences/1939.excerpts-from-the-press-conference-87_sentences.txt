Sentence 93: Q. How did yours run, do you know?
Sentence 94: THE PRESIDENT: Do you know at all, Steve
Sentence 95: [Mr. Early]?
MR. EARLY:
Sentence 96: Yes, sir.
Sentence 97: I know from the tabulation kept by the telegraph office last night and up to ten o'clock this morning, they were pro, with the exception, I think, of, he said, eight to ten, and two of those were not in exact opposition.
Sentence 98: They told me that they began to come in spontaneously; they were enthusiastic and the volume was in excess of any received after any of your recent speeches.
