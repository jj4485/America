Sentence 24: Q. Mr. President, when you went to Puerto Rico in 1948, you made a speech

in which you said something like this: I have said to the Congress several times, and I repeat it here, that the people of Puerto Rico should have the right to determine for themselves Puerto Rico's political relationships to the continental United States.
Sentence 25: Are those your sentiments now, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 26: Yes.

Sentence 35: Now they are about to adopt a Constitution which will virtually put them on a state hood basis, except they won't have two Senators and Representatives in the Congress.
Sentence 36: My position on the treatment of Puerto Rico has been exactly the same ever since I have been President--ever since I have been in the Congress.
Sentence 37: Q. One point there, Mr. President.
Sentence 38: I think you gave them several alternatives-statehood, freedom, or--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 39: The present thing that they are trying to do--
Q.--independence?
