Sentence 1: 1940 Excerpts From The Press Conference 79

Q. Sit down, Mr. Godwin.
Sentence 2: Q.
Sentence 3: [Mr. Godwin] Here I am, staggering.
Sentence 4: I sat through Russ Young's [an ex-reporter as a Commissioner of the District of Columbia] budget hearing.
Sentence 5: THE PRESIDENT: Was he good?
Sentence 6: (Laughter)
Q.
Sentence 7: [Mr. Godwin] He was wonderful.
Sentence 8: THE PRESIDENT: Did he know his stuff?
Sentence 9: Q.
Sentence 10: [Mr. Godwin] No. (Laughter) I wish you had been there to see this.
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT: How did you happen to discover—
Q.
Sentence 12: [Mr. Godwin, interposing]
Sentence 13: I just wanted to see Russ at a budget hearing.
Sentence 14: A delegation wanting more relief, see?
Sentence 15: You have heard of that?
Sentence 16: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 17: Yes.
MR. DONALDSON: All in.
Sentence 18: THE PRESIDENT: I think the only news of interest I have is that today is a red-letter day in American history.
Sentence 19: I very nearly issued a national Proclamation on the subject.
Sentence 20: It is Steve's
Sentence 21: [Mr. Early's] birthday.
Sentence 22: CHORUS: Happy birthday to you.
Sentence 23: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 24: So I leave him in your tender care.
Sentence 25: Maybe you will get a free drink out of it, I don't know.
Sentence 26: Q.
Sentence 27: Maybe.
Sentence 28: (Laughter)
Q.
Sentence 29: How about getting a piece of news out of him?
Sentence 30: (Laughter)
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 31: A piece of news out of him—that is an idea.
Sentence 32: I do not think I have anything else.
Sentence 33: We had one rather remarkable thing happen.
Sentence 34: During the past week the navy employment in Navy yards and stations, shore establishments of various kinds, increased 33 per cent in one week, so that we are getting up to what you who were with me, know I was aiming for, which was full production.
Q.
Sentence 35: Any idea of how much of that came from WPA people previously unemployed?
THE PRESIDENT: Only what we took up in one or two yards.
Sentence 36: I asked the question what percentage of these permanent employees had been taken off our WPA rolls and, as I remember the figure at Norfolk, it was that 40 per cent of the WPA rolls had gone on permanently, and they hoped to get another ten.
Sentence 37: I think in most places you will find that average is about right.
Sentence 38: Q. Mr. President, are you ready, or can you make any contribution to the argument that was started by Senator Byrd that only 343 planes have been ordered since you asked for 50,000?
Sentence 39: You know what I am talking about?
Sentence 40: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 41: Oh, I suppose it is largely a question of terminology.
Sentence 42: Q.
Sentence 43: We thought probably you might have some further figures.
Sentence 44: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 45: Oh, I have got all kinds of figures and it depends on whether we are talking about the same thing or not, or about something slightly different.
Sentence 46: For example, there are three types of figures you can take.
Sentence 47: You can take the total of signed orders, just for the American Army and Navy, or you can take a lot of categories; or you can take signed orders for all types of production; or you can take signed orders for combat planes and leave out all other types of planes, and you come to another category; or you can take all planes that are being worked on for the United States and other Governments; or you can take all planes that are being actually worked on for just the United States Government; or you can take all planes that are being worked on of a combat type.
Sentence 48: In other words, we haven't yet got to the use of identical language.
Sentence 49: Q. Well—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 50: [interposing] And the fact of the matter— I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put it in this way: What we are interested in at the present time are primarily two things.
Sentence 51: One is training of pilots and, therefore, a very large number of the planes that have been built are training planes because it is essential that we have pilots to be able to fly them.
Sentence 52: And the second thing is to increase the production capacity of the United States to build planes.
Sentence 53: And, taking it by and large, both of the objectives are coming along in excellent shape, considering—considering. . . .
Sentence 54: Q.
Sentence 55: [interposing] Considering what?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 56: And May [Miss Craig] says "What?"
Sentence 57: Right.
Sentence 58: Considering several facts, that on the twenty-eighth day of June, just for example, a large pile of contracts were ready to be signed—and Congress changed the law so that they all had to be rewritten.
Sentence 59: 'that is No. 1.
Sentence 60: No. 2, the major part of the appropriation for planes, the larger part, much the larger part, is in the Appropriation Bill which is still in the Congress of the United States.
Sentence 61: Q. I cannot hear you, sir.
Sentence 62: THE PRESIDENT: Much the larger part of this order is still in the bill which is still in the Congress.
Sentence 63: It passed the House, and was passed out by the Senate Committee, and it is still on the Senate floor, and it has not come to me for signature, and I cannot order planes.
Sentence 64: Q. Is that what Senator Byrd is proposing to investigate?
Sentence 65: THE PRESIDENT: I think so—I hope so.
Sentence 66: (Laughter)
Sentence 67: Q. Are you going to—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 68: [interposing] Now, we will talk about productive capacity.
Sentence 69: I will give you some figures.
Sentence 70: About-
Sentence 71: what was it?
Sentence 72: The first of September last, wasn't it?
Sentence 73: that the war broke out—the productive capacity for military planes and naval planes of all kinds, which includes training planes, was about 600 a month; and this month we are turning out, actually turning out, and delivering at about the rate of 10,000 a year.
Sentence 74: By the first of January, that ought to be up to about 13 or 14 thousand a year, and during 1941 again the productive capacity will be up to somewhere around 24,000 a year.
Sentence 75: The productive capacity in 1942, early in that year, will be 36,000 a year.
Sentence 76: Those figures come from Mr. Biggers and on actual contracts—mind you, there is a difference between contracts and planes on which work has begun without a contract-Biggers says this: he says, "War and Navy have under contract and, undelivered 6,361; and, in addition, there are being built under letters of intention—in other words, the work is going on although the contract has not been signed since we are waiting for legislation and we are waiting for the tax bill, too, but the work is going ahead—3,054 airplanes and 600 Navy planes."
Sentence 77: Is that right, Steve
Sentence 78: [Mr. Early]?
MR. EARLY; Yes, sir.
Sentence 79: THE PRESIDENT: Six hundred Navy planes.
Sentence 80: Now, there hasn't been a contract signed for any of that 3,000 or any of the 600, but the work is going on. . . .
Sentence 81: Q. At the present time would it be possible to increase the number of planes under construction for this Government without reducing the number under construction for other Governments?
Sentence 82: THE PRESIDENT: No, not at this time, because you have a limited productive capacity.
Sentence 83: If your productive capacity is, say, a thousand a month, that is 12,000 a year, you can only turn out 12,000 a year.
Sentence 84: Then you come to an entirely different question: How many of those 12,000 should stay here and how many should go out of the country?
Sentence 85: That is an entirely separate question.
Sentence 86: Q.
Sentence 87: As I read those figures, that means a little more than 10,000 planes are being built?
Sentence 88: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 89: They are being delivered today at the rate of 10,000 planes a year.
Sentence 90: In other words, 800 and something a month.
Sentence 91: Q.
Sentence 92: The work is being done on them?
Sentence 93: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 94: They are being delivered at the rate of 10,000 a year and, at the present rate of delivery, it is 800 and some planes.
Sentence 95: Next month it will be 900 and some planes, and the month after that a thousand and some planes—actually delivered.
Q.
Sentence 96: The figures that John Biggers gave you were 6,361 and 3,054 plus 600?
Sentence 97: THE PRESIDENT: That is right.
Sentence 98: Q. Is that included in this rate?
Sentence 99: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Sentence 100: Those are for the War and Navy Departments.
Sentence 101: Q.
Sentence 102: This rate you spoke of—800 a month, is that another addition?
Sentence 103: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 104: Yes.
Q.
Sentence 105: My question was misunderstood.
Sentence 106: I added those figures—I just added them—as work being under construction without contracts.
Sentence 107: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 108: Yes, the last two.
Sentence 109: The first bunch of 6,361 is what the War and Navy Departments have under contract today, that is to say, signed contracts.
Sentence 110: The last two figures represent what the Army and Navy are having built, that number under letters of intent, and the work is under way.
Sentence 111: Q. Can the same thing be said, as to satisfactory progress, on army materiel other than airplanes?
Sentence 112: Tanks, et cetera?
THE PRESIDENT: Except for this Appropriation Bill.
Sentence 113: Q. Is there satisfactory progress?
Sentence 114: Are you satisfied with the progress?
Sentence 115: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 116: Yes.
Sentence 117: Of course you have to recognize one single fact.
Sentence 118: For example, some of the light tanks were given, as I remember it, to the Baldwin Locomotive Company because we had built, in the past, what the Army had put in for.
Sentence 119: But these new orders are perfectly colossal compared with what the Army considered as needed, the old needs before this German attack this spring, so it means that Baldwin, for instance, on light tanks has to get special tools for them.
Sentence 120: In other words, you cannot build a tank with an automobile outfit.
Sentence 121: They let, the other day, that contract—what was it?-$50,000,000 for medium tanks to Chrysler.
Sentence 122: My Lord!
Sentence 123: He has to put up a new plant for it, and here he gets a $30,000,000 order and he gets $20,000,000 by loan-isn't that right?
Sentence 124: Q. Yes, sir.
Sentence 125: THE PRESIDENT:—from RFC.
Sentence 126: He gets a $30,000,000 order, $30,000,000 for tanks and $20,000,000 for a plant.
Sentence 127: I suppose it will take Chrysler a great many months before he gets that actually into full production, because nobody could possibly build a tank without the equipment to build a tank—and the same way with a plane.
Sentence 128: They think that things are coming along, on the whole, very well.
Sentence 129: We are waiting—of course, we are held up by this $5,000,000,000 Appropriation Bill quite seriously.
Sentence 130: Q. Is it a fair inference from these remarks of yours on airplanes and other army materiel that you are satisfied with the production rates?
Sentence 131: THE PRESIDENT: All I can tell you is a simple thing, and that is that the best business brains we are able to get together seem satisfied with the production, considering the status of the legislation—and I am putting that other consideration in.
Sentence 132: Q. Do you feel, Mr. President, that any delay is being caused by a demand on the part of industry, as a whole, for unreasonable profits?
Sentence 133: There has been a good deal of talk on that in Congress.
Sentence 134: THE PRESIDENT: I have taken a simple position on that, and that is that it is up to the Congress to pass whatever excess profits tax Congress thinks should be put on, in order to prevent the creation of another crop of American millionaires.
Sentence 135: And that is the position of every responsible businessman who is now working with the Government—the same as mine, every one of them.
Sentence 136: Knudsen feels the same way.
Sentence 137: That legislation, we hope, is on its way through.
Sentence 138: The contracts are ready under that legislation and the contracting parties—that is to say the industrial makers of these machines-seem to be entirely satisfied, as long as they know where they are going.
Sentence 139: That is all they are asking.
Sentence 140: They want information and nothing else; and that was put up to the Congress—I think, oh, about the twentieth day of June-the tenth day of June—something like that.
Sentence 141: Q. Would it be a fair thing to picture the American industry doing this job just as well as it makes iceboxes and automobiles, after they get this legislation and other things out of the way?
Sentence 142: THE PRESIDENT: When they know where they are going, when we get the appropriations through, and the third thing is when we get the Draft Bill through.
Sentence 143: Those three things.
Sentence 144: Q. Is there any delay in tooling on account of this—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 145: [interposing] In some things tool-making is part of the bottleneck, in others it is not.
Sentence 146: It depends entirely on the article.
Sentence 147: Q. Does any bottleneck in tool-making have any relation to the failure of Congress to act?
Sentence 148: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 149: No.
Sentence 150: Q.
Sentence 151: Mr. President, you said these contracts are being made with this excess profits legislation in mind?
Sentence 152: THE PRESIDENT: You have them all sitting on the desk, waiting to be signed up.
Sentence 153: Q.
Sentence 154: As soon as the legislation is passed?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 155: Yes, except the contracts that have already been let and signed.
Q. Are those now supplemented by the letters of intention?
Sentence 156: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 157: The old ones are; the new ones are not.
Sentence 158: Q. In other words, it is an informal one?
Sentence 159: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 160: Yes.
Sentence 161: Q.
Sentence 162: I think you included the Draft Bill in the three things.
Sentence 163: Will you explain why the Draft Bill is holding up any speed or anything?
Sentence 164: I cannot quite say I understand it.
Sentence 165: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 166: Because if and when the Draft Bill goes through we shall need a lot of other things, undoubtedly, and we cannot-there are all kinds of preparations we cannot make until the thing goes through.
Sentence 167: Q.
Sentence 168: That has to do with your plans rather than any drag on industry?
Sentence 169: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 170: Yes.
Sentence 171: Q.
Sentence 172: Do you have any figures, sir, that show how many of these contracts have been signed since the Defense Commission started in business?
Sentence 173: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 174: No.
Q.
Sentence 175: I wondered if all these contracts you spoke of are since the Defense Commission began operation?
Sentence 176: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Sentence 177: Some are, and some are not.
Sentence 178: I do not think there is any relationship.
Sentence 179: Q. Do you agree with your rival, Mr. Willkie, that there should be a formal head of the Defense Commission?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 180: I don't know.
Sentence 181: I don't "know nothing" about politics.
Sentence 182: (Laughter) . .
Sentence 183: .
Sentence 184: Q. Have you any other business for Congress after this defense-these three defense items?
Sentence 185: THE PRESIDENT: Nothing important.
Sentence 186: I suppose there will be-what do they call it?
Sentence 187: at the end—a fiscal Deficiency Bill, or something like that.
Sentence 188: Q. How about a new Postmaster General?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 189: Oh, I shall give you something on that—in a few days.
Sentence 190: (Laughter) . .
Sentence 191: .
Sentence 192: Q. Another question: Do you have any preference, or is there any decision yet on which agency handles the defense housing program- building houses for workers near factories?
Sentence 193: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 194: Well, I shall ask you a question.
Sentence 195: I shall give you two places; one place is near a very populous city, near it, where there are all kinds of men that can put up the money for homes for workmen under the FHA.
Sentence 196: That is the first case.
Sentence 197: There is another case of a city where they have a very excellent U.S. Housing Authority, an organization, and they need there a combination of slum clearance and additional quarters.
Sentence 198: Obviously that is a USHA job.
Sentence 199: Well, down around, south of Jacksonville, out in the palmetto scrub, they are building a new Naval Air Station.
Sentence 200: There is no community near it.
Sentence 201: It needs some civilian workers' quarters.
Sentence 202: You can't get any private capital to go in, and it is the type of work that the USHA has not done, that FHA hasn't done.
Sentence 203: Who should build that?
Sentence 204: Should the Navy build it?
Sentence 205: In other words, doesn't it depend largely on where the thing is and what it is?
Sentence 206: It is just a matter of common sense.
Sentence 207: In other words, you cannot have one agency and one rule to do the whole thing.
Sentence 208: As a general proposition we want to get as much private capital into this as we can, and we want to eliminate as many slums as we possibly can.
Sentence 209: At the same time, we want to get the quarters built.
Sentence 210: They may be way of[ in the wilds and the Army or Navy would do it in that case. . . .
Sentence 211: Q. Could you tell us the latest developments on naval and air bases offered by Britain?
Sentence 212: THE PRESIDENT: Nothing yet, Pete
Sentence 213: [Mr. Brandt].
Sentence 214: Q. One other question on this controversy on airplane production: Do you feel there is any justice in the accusation, which some of us have seen in print, that there is a sit-down strike by American industry which is holding up construction?
Sentence 215: THE PRESIDENT: I am told by Mr. Knudsen and Mr. Stettinius and the other members of the Council that they have not seen any of that yet, and I guess they know probably pretty well.
Sentence 216: Q. Mr. President, were Senator Byrd's figures as to airplanes incorrect as applied to the combat type of the Army and Navy over the period he covers?
Sentence 217: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 218: Yes, they were incorrect in this sense, that the actual figures were correct and the implication was dead wrong.
Sentence 219: Q.
Sentence 220: That is the way—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 221: [interposing] That is the way to talk.
Sentence 222: Q.
Sentence 223: I would like to draw you back to that housing matter again.
Sentence 224: There seems to be something stopping or holding back the Housing Bill on the House side—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 225: [interposing] I know there is.
Sentence 226: Q.—as far as I know.
Sentence 227: Do you know anything about that, sir?
Sentence 228: THE PRESIDENT: I think there are too many ramifications.
Sentence 229: I think that is about the easiest way of putting it.
Sentence 230: Q.
Sentence 231: As I understand it, you would like to see the bill passed?
Sentence 232: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 233: Sure.
Sentence 234: I have to get houses.
