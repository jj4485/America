THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 4: [1.]
Sentence 5: Q. Mr. President, there is a report from Rio to the effect that there have been some diplomatic conversations regarding a possible visit to the United States of the apparent President-elect Vargas before his inauguration in January.

Sentence 7: It has not come to my attention as yet.
Sentence 8: [2.]
Sentence 9: Q. Mr. President, now that the answer to the Bell report has been released, may we have the Bell report?

Sentence 25: Q. Mr. President, do you care to comment on a story in the papers this morning that you might call Congress back on the 8th--no, the 12th--before the 27th of November?
Sentence 26: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 27: There has been some discussion between one or two of the leaders-the Vice President particularly, and myself-on the advisability of calling them back, at least a week or 10 days before the date they set, because it only gives them about 2Â½ weeks of actual working time if they come back here on the 27th.
Sentence 28: I haven't come to a conclusion yet as to whether to call them back.
Sentence 29: I intend to consult with the congressional leaders and get their opinions on the subject, before a decision is reached.
Sentence 30: Just a matter of having a little more working time, that's all.
Sentence 31: They have quite a bit to do.
Sentence 32: Q. Mr. President, at any rate, whatever your decision is, do you anticipate issuing the call before election ?
Sentence 33: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 34: The call will be issued when I make the decision, whether it is before or after the election.
Sentence 35: [5.]
Sentence 36: Q. Mr. President, do you believe that Congress can enact a rent control law in that 2 1/2 weeks?
Sentence 37: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: Well, I don't know whether they can or not.
Sentence 39: There are other things that are just as important as the rent control law.
Sentence 40: The statehood for Alaska and Hawaii are vitally important, and then the excess profits tax is exceedingly important.
Sentence 41: I have a whole list of things that they will want to look into, and I will give you that list if I do decide to call them back.
Q.
Sentence 42: In that connection, Mr. President, can you say when you consider uncontrolled business rents an inflationary factor, and whether or not you plan to ask for rent controls on commercial properties ?
Sentence 43: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: I haven't gone into any details on that.
Sentence 45: I don't think I can answer that question intelligently.
Sentence 46: [6].Q. Mr. President, the delegates of the Inter-American Press Conference, who had expected to visit you, were in Washington during your absence.
Sentence 47: Did you have a chance to acquaint yourself with their work, or have you any ideas about their activities, which was to organize an inter-American press association--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 48: I haven't gone into it, but I think it is a good idea.
Sentence 49: [7.]
Sentence 50: Q. Mr. President, last night Harold Stassen, president of the University of Pennsylvania, said in a radio address that after the election the Truman administration plans to quietly embrace the regime of Mao Tse-tung, and to encourage the seating of Communist China in the United Nations.
Sentence 51: Do you have any comment, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: I wonder where he got his information?
Sentence 53: I believe he must have gotten that from Gabrielson.
Sentence 54: 3
He didn't get it from me.
Sentence 55: [Laughter]
3 Guy G. Gabrielson, Chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Sentence 56: [8.]

Sentence 59: Q.--but
Sentence 60: John Gunther has written an article, in which he said that General MacArthur knew nothing about plans for dropping the atomic bomb on Japan.
Sentence 61: Do you have any comment, or can you throw any light on that?
Sentence 62: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: It just isn't true.
Sentence 64: Q. Not true?
Sentence 65: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: It's just not true.
Sentence 67: Q.
Sentence 68: He did know?
Sentence 69: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: Of course he did.
Sentence 71: He had to make the order.
Sentence 72: I gave the order to him and he gave the order to the men to drop the bomb.
Sentence 73: How do you suppose you transact business militarily?
Sentence 74: [Laughter]
Sentence 75: [9.]
Sentence 76: Q. Mr. President, you sent Congress a memorandum connected with the dispersal of Government buildings in Washington, and since then, so far as I know, it has either been pigeonholed or nothing has happened.
Sentence 77: Are you satisfied with what is--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: It is not pigeonholed.
Sentence 79: I will continue to press it.
Sentence 80: It is logical, practical, and should be done.
Sentence 81: Q.
Sentence 82: You are not dropping it?
Sentence 83: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: Not at all.
Sentence 85: [10.]
Sentence 86: Q. Do you have any comment to make on the Philippine answer to the Bell report?

Sentence 90: [11.]
Sentence 91: Q. Mr. President, at Gordon Dean's press conference the other day, he was asked if we had any more evidence of Russian development of another atomic explosion since your last statement.
Sentence 92: I was just wondering if you would tell us anything?
Sentence 93: He referred the matter to you.
Sentence 94: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 95: No, I don't know anything to tell you, so I can't tell you anything.
Sentence 96: Q.
Sentence 97: You mean you have no further evidence?
Sentence 98: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 99: No further information on the subject at all.
Sentence 100: [12.]
Sentence 101: Q. Mr. President, may I ask another question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 102: Sure.
Sentence 103: Q.
Sentence 104: As the United Nations forces seem to be very close to the Manchurian border, I wonder if you can say, sir, whether we plan to go directly to the border?
Sentence 105: There have been several reports that we might not go that far.
Sentence 106: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: My understanding is that the Korean divisions will occupy the Korean border on the Korean side.
Sentence 108: Q.
Sentence 109: Not the American troops?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 110: No.
Sentence 111: That is my understanding.
Sentence 112: Q. Does that apply also to the Soviet frontier-Siberian frontier?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 113: It's the whole northern frontier of Korea.
Sentence 114: [13.]
Sentence 115: Q. Mr. President, just to make that last question completely clear to us, does that mean that so far as our Government knows, there has only been one atomic explosion in Russia?
Sentence 116: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: That is so far as I know.
Sentence 118: The one that was publicly reported.
Sentence 119: 4
That's correct.
Sentence 120: 4 For the statement by the President announcing the first atomic explosion in the Soviet Union, see the 1949 volume, this series, Item 216.

Sentence 125: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 137: Q. Mr. President, Bill Boyle yesterday said he had urged you very strongly to make some campaign speeches between now and election time, and he indicated you might tell us your plans this morning?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 138: Well, to tell you the honest truth, I have been urged by the National Chairman--as he should--in an endeavor to do what I can to elect a Democratic ticket, to make some political speeches.
Sentence 139: I have not yet made up my mind to do it.
Sentence 140: Should I make up my mind to make one or two, I will give you plenty of notice so that you can pack your bags and do whatever is necessary.
Sentence 141: Q. Well, Mr. President--
Q.
Sentence 142: Mr. President--excuse me--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 143: What is it?
Sentence 144: Q.--does that mean that if you do decide to make some political speeches that you might make them out of town?
Sentence 145: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 146: No.
Sentence 147: No.
