Sentence 2: The Presidents News Conference 495

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 3: Well, I called this press conference at the suggestion of Mr. Ross, because I thought you hadn't all had a chance to look me in the face or ask me any impertinent questions.
Sentence 4: [Laughter] I haven't anything that you would break your arms to get out of the door for this morning.
Sentence 5: [Laughter] If you have questions to ask me--
[L] I have issued a proclamation setting aside Sunday as a day of prayer.
Sentence 6: After the 2 days' celebration I think we will need the prayer.

I am ready for any questions you have to ask.
Sentence 8: I will answer them if I can.
Sentence 9: [2.]
Sentence 10: Q. Mr. President, the question I have written down here is: What is to be done with those three huge plants in the Manhattan project?
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 12: That is going to be up to the Congress.
Sentence 13: That Manhattan project product, in the long run, will be used for the welfare and benefit of the world instead of its destruction; and if Congress is willing to go along, we will continue the experiments to show how we can use that for peace instead of war.
Sentence 14: Q. Are the wheels now turning ?
Sentence 15: --do you happen to know ?

Sentence 20: Q. Mr. President, did you notice that the Japanese radio speakers indicate they are looking for revenge in the future?
Sentence 21: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 22: Nearly every defeated people does that.
Sentence 23: That is natural.
Sentence 24: But I don't think they will have any chance at it.
Sentence 25: I don't think they will be able to implement it at all; at least, I hope not.
Sentence 26: Q. Mr. President, there still seems to be a little confusion as to the legal status of V-J Day, when it comes.
Sentence 27: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 28: V-J will be declared by proclamation when the terms of surrender are signed and implemented.
Sentence 29: The surrender isn't complete.
Sentence 30: There are still two million Japs fully armed.
Sentence 31: Q. Will that day, once it is proclaimed--do you envision it as a holiday ?
Sentence 32: People will not be expected to work, will they?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: I think they have had their holidays.

Sentence 58: No, there was nothing he could do about it.
Sentence 59: Q. Mr. President, are you aware of any negotiations or conversations now with Korea?
Sentence 60: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 61: No, I am not.
Sentence 62: Q.
Sentence 63: You know the situation; the Koreans are asking--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: Yes, the Korean situation was discussed at Berlin, and the Korean program, I think, will be carried through as we anticipated-that it will be a free country.
Sentence 65: [9.]
Sentence 66: Q. Mr. President, is Manila definitely fixed as the surrender place now?

Sentence 76: Q. Mr. President, was there any term of years fixed on the occupation of Germany?
Sentence 77: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: No.
Q.
Sentence 79: Some thought the 2-year reparations period indicates that we might get out in that time.
Sentence 80: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: The occupation will depend entirely on how well the Germans rehabilitate themselves on the democratic way of life.
Sentence 82: Q. Does that apply to the Japanese also?
Sentence 83: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: It certainly will.

Sentence 88: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: They have not.
Sentence 90: Q. Are you anticipating any trips in the near future?

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: That is a matter that Congress will have to decide.
Sentence 109: The draft is only temporarily continued for the need to get those soldiers who have been fighting discharged first.
Sentence 110: There is no reason why these young fellows who have nothing to do now should not replace the ones who have done the fighting so they can be discharged.
Sentence 111: The Congress will have to pass on that when they meet.
Sentence 112: Q. Mr. President, are you going to make recommendations on what kind of peacetime military training we are to have?

Sentence 133: [18.]
Sentence 134: Q. What was the American view on Palestine at Berlin?
Sentence 135: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 136: The American view of Palestine is, we want to let as many of the Jews into Palestine as it is possible to let into that country.
Sentence 137: Then the matter will have to be worked out diplomatically with the British and the Arabs, so that if a state can be set up there they may be able to set it up on a peaceful basis.
Sentence 138: I have no desire to send 500,000 American soldiers there to make peace in Palestine.
