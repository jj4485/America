Sentence 1: 1950 The Presidents News Conference 585

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I have a statement here that I want to make.
Sentence 4: It will be available for you in mimeographed form after the press conference is over.
Sentence 5: [Reading] "It has long been the view of the United States Government that the people of Japan were entitled to a peace treaty which would bring them back into the family of nations.
Sentence 6: As is well known, the United States Government first made an effort in 1947 to call a conference of the nations holding membership in the Far Eastern Commission to discuss a peace treaty with Japan.
Sentence 7: However, procedural difficulties at that time and since have prevented any progress.
Sentence 8: "The United States Government now believes that an effort should again be made in this direction, and I have therefore authorized the Department of State to initiate informal discussions as to the future procedure, in the first instance with those governments represented on the Far Eastern Commission, and the ones most actively concerned in the Pacific war.
Sentence 9: It is not expected that any formal action will be taken until an opportunity has been had to assess the results of these informal discussions.
Sentence 10: "The policy in regard to a Japanese peace treaty is in accord with the general effort of the United States to bring an end to all the war situations.
Sentence 11: We have long pressed the U.S.S.R. for an Austrian treaty, and we are exploring the possibility of ending the state of war with Germany."
Sentence 12: Any questions?
Sentence 13: I will be glad to try to answer questions.
Sentence 14: [2.]
Sentence 15: Q. Mr. President, recently you said that Secretary Johnson would not resign while you are President, and that he was not embarrassing you.

Sentence 17: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 18: The letter speaks for itself.
Sentence 19: I have no further comment to make.
Sentence 20: That is a closed incident.
Sentence 21: 1

Sentence 23: Q. Mr. President, in his Chicago speech last night, Chairman Guy Gabrielson

Sentence 24: Have you any comment on that?
Sentence 25: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 41: That is customary.
Sentence 42: 4
Charles G. Ross, Secretary to the President.
Sentence 43: Q. Yes sir.
Sentence 44: Have you received any from the three Secretaries of the services?
Sentence 45: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 46: No, I haven't.
Sentence 47: Q.
Sentence 48: Do you expect that to come, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 49: I judge soon.
Sentence 50: It is customary.
Sentence 51: That doesn't necessarily mean that they will be accepted.
Sentence 52: Q. Mr. President, have you selected a Deputy Secretary of Defense yet?

Sentence 55: I will announce it as soon as I select one.

Sentence 58: [6.]
Sentence 59: Q. Mr. President, in the informal discussions between the Department of State with members of the Far Eastern Commission on the proposed Big Three with Japan, will the discussions also be held with the U.S.S.R.?

Sentence 62: They are a party to it.
Sentence 63: They had their occupation forces in Japan.
Sentence 64: [7.]
Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, do you feel any better about the Mundt-Nixon-Ferguson-Wood bill?
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: I think I made the statement to you last week that the Mundt-Nixon bill, in the form in which I knew it, was objectionable to me, and if it had come to me I wouldn't sign it.
Sentence 68: If it came up in that form, I would feel the same way.
Sentence 69: But, of course, I can't pass on legislation until it is before me and has been analyzed.
Sentence 70: The bill has to be rewritten in conference, as the House and Senate are not in agreement as to what the bill will contain.
Sentence 71: When the bill comes before me, I will have it analyzed
Sentence 72: and then I will let you know exactly what I am going to do with it, and promptly.

Sentence 76: Q.
Sentence 77: I just wondered if the additions to that had been--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: I can't answer that because I don't know what it is.
Sentence 79: That is the reason I have to wait and see what I am going to do.
Sentence 80: Go ahead.
Sentence 81: Q.
Sentence 82: I wanted to get that straightened out.

Sentence 87: [9.]

Sentence 93: Yes, I have.
Sentence 94: I am very much pleased with them.
Sentence 95: The Democrats made tremendous gains in the Maine election.
Sentence 96: They have cast the largest Democratic vote in Maine than they ever had before--larger than 1948.
Sentence 97: And the Republicans cast a smaller vote than they did in 1948.
