Sentence 1: 1948 The Presidents News Conference 369

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: It just now occurred to me, when my friend here mentioned it, that this happens to be V-J Day.
Sentence 4: 1
Just 3 years ago today the Japanese surrender was signed aboard the battleship Missouri.
Sentence 5: I had thought by this time we would have a settled and permanent peace, but we are still working at it, and eventually we will get it, I am sure.
Sentence 6: 1
Prior to the formal opening of the news conference, one of the reporters had mentioned that it was the third anniversary of V-J Day.
Sentence 7: [2.]
Sentence 8: We are issuing a health report today, on which I want to read you a statement which will be mimeographed and available for your use when this press conference is over.
Sentence 9: [Reading] "In January of this year I asked Oscar Ewing, the Federal Security Administrator, to undertake a comprehensive study of the possibilities for raising the level of the Nation's health and to report to me feasible goals which might be realized in the next decade.
Sentence 10: The report of the Administrator, entitled "The Nation's Health--A Ten Year Plan," has now been transmitted to me.
Sentence 11: 1
1
The report is dated September 1948 (Government Printing Office, 186 pp.).
Sentence 12: For the President's letter of January 30 to the Administrator requesting him to undertake the study, see Item 16 above.
Sentence 13: "This report is an impressive document, which describes where we are today with respect to the health of our people and the goals toward which we must move.
Sentence 14: The report recognizes the great advances that we have made in recent decades toward improving health and relieving suffering.
Sentence 15: It makes equally plain the additional progress we must make, and outlines a series of objectives which will be important guides for years to come to all who are working to improve the Nation's health.
Sentence 16: "The report demonstrates that we now have, and will face for years to come, serious shortages of doctors, of dentists, of nurses, of hospitals, and other medical care facilities.
Sentence 17: These shortages, together with the fact that millions of our citizens cannot afford good medical care, are the principal obstacles which must be overcome if we are to bring good health within the reach of everyone in this country.
Sentence 18: "These facts further emphasize the need for the national health program which I have previously recommended to the Congress.
Sentence 19: 1
The program includes five major points.
Sentence 20: "
I will take these rather slowly.
Sentence 21: 1
See 1945 volume, this series, Item 192; 1947 volume, Item 98.
Sentence 22: "1.
Sentence 23: Adequate public health services, including an expanded maternal and child health program.
Sentence 24: "2.
Sentence 25: Additional medical research and medical education.
Sentence 26: "3.
Sentence 27: More hospitals and more doctors--in every area of the country where they are needed.
Sentence 28: "4. Insurance against the costs of medical care.
Sentence 29: "5. Protection against loss of earnings during illness.
Sentence 30: "I believe that Federal legislation in accordance with this program would carry us far toward the objectives stated in this report.
Sentence 31: However, more than Federal legislation is needed.
Sentence 32: State and local governments, medical schools of all types, hospitals, members of the medical professions and other interested groups, and citizens will all have to work together if we are to reach our objectives.
Sentence 33: "For this reason I believe that the National Health Assembly, which met here last May, was an extremely important gathering.
Sentence 34: This assembly, consisting of more than 800 professional and community leaders, reached a wide area of agreement on the Nation's health needs and on ways and means of meeting them.
Sentence 35: Except for the recommendation for national health insurance, that assembly's conclusions support every major recommendation of this report.
Sentence 36: That assembly indorsed the principle of contributory insurance as the basic method for financing medical care for the large majority of our people, but took no position for or against national health insurance.
Sentence 37: "No health program, of course, can stand alone and apart from the economic and social circumstances of our citizens as individuals and as families.
Sentence 38: Our boys and girls and men and women will gain and hold good health not only from a sound health program, as such, but from decent housing, from adequate nutrition, and from proper education.
Sentence 39: It is clear that only as we move forward with a broad program to benefit the well-being of all our people will we be able to achieve the kind of health of which this Nation is capable.
Sentence 40: "The principal value of this report is that it outlines broad objectives and definite methods of achieving them.
Sentence 41: We can have more hospitals, more doctors, more dentists, more medical specialists of all kinds.
Sentence 42: We can provide better health care for all the people of our land.
Sentence 43: I heartily commend this report to every citizen who looks forward to these goals .
Sentence 44: "
This report will be available for you in mimeographed form as soon as this conference is over.
Sentence 45: Q. Mr. President, the report to which you refer was issued by the White House for release this afternoon at 6 o'clock?
Sentence 46: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: Six o'clock, that is correct.
Sentence 48: Q. Does a similar release apply to the statement, or may we put it out now?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 49: It can be used now.
Sentence 50: Of course, it has to be released on schedule, but the statement can be used now.
Sentence 51: I am giving it to you now for that purpose.
Sentence 52: Any questions?
Sentence 53: [3.]
Sentence 54: Q. Mr. President, in connection with the V-J Day statement, I wonder if you would tell us, in the recent four-power conference, whether anything has developed to provide the basis for your hope for eventual peace?
Sentence 55: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 56: I can't comment on that, but at a later date I think you will come to the conclusion that I know what I am talking about.
Sentence 57: I have no comment to make on the four-power meetings in Europe.
Sentence 58: Q. Mr. President, could you tell us what the foundation for your optimism is?
Sentence 59: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 60: I can't comment off that.
Sentence 61: [4.]
Sentence 62: Q. Anything new, Mr. President, on campaign plans after the Labor Day trip?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: I think that Mr. Ross announced that we will go to Des Moines on the 18th, and further plans will be announced when I get back from Detroit.
Sentence 64: They are not completed as yet, and we can't go any further than the starting point, which is Des Moines.
Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, do you expect a more cordial reception in the South than Mr. Wallace received?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: Oh, of course, I will receive a cordial reception, I am sure, wherever I go.
Sentence 67: Without comparisons, please.
Sentence 68: [5.]
Sentence 69: Q. Mr. President, you made a very important statement, and I didn't hear the question.
Sentence 70: Is this correct: In your opening statement you said that you eventually hope for peace, and a gentleman asked you a question; and you said regardless of the fact that you are not saying anything now about the four-power conference, you still believe in eventual peace?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 71: That is correct.
Sentence 72: Correct.
Sentence 73: [6.]
Sentence 74: Q. Mr. President, are you going to Des Moines?
Sentence 75: I understood you were going to Dexter?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: Yes, that's right.
Sentence 77: It's about 18 miles east of Des Moines.
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, you will go to Des Moines then, too?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: I will go through Des Moines to go to Dexter.
Sentence 80: Q. Will there be a stop in Des Moines?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: I can't answer that question until the details are arranged.
Sentence 82: You will be notified and well-informed in detail when I get back from Detroit.
Sentence 83: Q. Mr. President, aside from any actual details, can you tell us approximately when you will go South?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: No, I can't.
Sentence 85: No arrangements have been made.
Sentence 86: Q.
Sentence 87: You do intend to go South, though, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 88: I hope so.
Sentence 89: Q. Mr. President, 6 days after you make 5 speeches in Michigan, Senator Homer Ferguson is up for reelection.
Sentence 90: I wonder if you are going to suggest during the speeches that Senator Ferguson be impeached by the voters?1
Sentence 91: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: No comment on that.
Sentence 93: [ More laughter ]
1 Senator Homer Ferguson served as Chairman of the Investigations Subcommittee of the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments which at the time was investigating Communist influence in the Government.
Sentence 94: Q. Mr. President, do you plan to speak in your home State during this campaign?
Sentence 95: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: Yes, certainly.
Sentence 97: Q. Will you close your campaign in Independence ?
Sentence 98: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 99: That is customary.
Sentence 100: I don't know whether it will be in Independence.
Sentence 101: Wherever it will be--somewhere in Missouri, I hope.
Sentence 102: Q. Do you expect to speak in Chicago, Mr. President, during the campaign?
Sentence 103: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: Yes, I think eventually I will land in Chicago.
Sentence 105: Q. Late or early in the campaign?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 106: Can't answer that.
Sentence 107: I will give you details later.
Sentence 108: Q.
Sentence 109: I think we were told at some time that you planned to speak both in Kansas City and St. Louis during the campaign?
Sentence 110: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: That is the present plan.
Sentence 112: But then that is subject to change without notice.
Sentence 113: I will let you know the details as soon as we have them all worked out.
Sentence 114: It is a very difficult matter to work them out, because everybody wants you to stop at every whistlestop.
Sentence 115: That's what we want to do, if we can.
Sentence 116: [7.]
Sentence 117: Q. Mr. President, are you prepared to announce the selection of the Air Judge Advocate?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 118: No, I am not.
Sentence 119: That is under consideration.
Sentence 120: I am not ready to announce it yet.
Sentence 121: [8.]
Sentence 122: Q. Mr. President, some of the whistlestops prefer not to be called whistlestops--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 123: Los Angeles and San Francisco and Seattle, for instance.
Sentence 124: [Laughter]
Q. Speaking of whistlestops, does that mean you will probably make most of your campaign by train, and probably not by plane?
Sentence 125: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 126: I can't answer that, but that is the present intention, of course, to go by train.
Sentence 127: [9.]
Sentence 128: Q. Mr. President, Mr. Stassen charges that the administration is deliberately trying to keep food prices up.
Sentence 129: Is that correct, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 130: The Secretary of Agriculture will answer Mr. Stassen's statement in full, and it will be a complete answer.
Sentence 131: I noticed an article this afternoon in the Star,
1
in which it says $300 million have been expended to support crop prices, and it would imply that that had been done in the last year.
Sentence 132: It hasn't been done in the last year.
Sentence 133: If you will read the article carefully, you will find that it covers a 5- to 10-year period.
Sentence 134: 1
Washington Evening Star.
Sentence 135: Q. Mr. President, don't you think that the crop support program is not a big factor in prices?
Sentence 136: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 137: It is not.
Sentence 138: [10.]
Sentence 139: Q. Mr. President, here is a hardy perennial.
Sentence 140: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 141: All right.
Sentence 142: Good.
Sentence 143: Q.
Sentence 144: On the St. Lawrence power project, that it was cheaper to do it from the navigation channel?
Sentence 145: A formal application to that effect has come from New York authorities?
Sentence 146: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 147: I wouldn't approve it.
Sentence 148: I haven't seen it, but I will not approve it, I can say that to you definitely.
Sentence 149: The St. Lawrence project goes through as a whole or not at all, so far as I am concerned.
Sentence 150: [11.]
Sentence 151: Q. Like the reply by the Secretary of Agriculture, are you having campaign charges answered by various experts in the way of protocol arrangements?
Sentence 152: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 153: I don't think that was a campaign charge, that was just a misstatement of facts, and I am having the facts put out to you to know.
Sentence 154: [12.]
Sentence 155: Q. Mr. President, Governor Dewey said yesterday that cleaning the Communists out of Washington was a national job of great urgency, and one that should be tackled as soon as a Republican President could get it done.
Sentence 156: Any comment on that?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 157: I think Mr. Dewey is mistaken about Communists in Government.
Sentence 158: There has been a program, ever since the war started, to see that disloyal people are not in Government, and very few disloyal people have been found in Government, and those few have been discharged long ago.
Sentence 159: I think Mr. Dewey's intention is to eliminate the Democrats from Government, not the Communists.
Sentence 160: [Laughter]
Sentence 161: [13.]
Sentence 162: Q. Mr. President, will you go to upstate New York in your campaign trips?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 164: I can't answer the question now.
Sentence 165: [14.]
Sentence 166: Q. Mr. President, some people have said that you must back down on your "red herring" characterization of the spy investigation?
Sentence 167: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 168: I am not going to back down on that because it is a fact, and I will prove it before the campaign is over.
Sentence 169: Q.
Sentence 170: It has been charged that you are protecting Communists.
Sentence 171: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 172: Of course, that is just a lie out of the whole cloth, and you know it.
Sentence 173: I never protected Communists or any other disloyal people.
Sentence 174: You know, the spies that really caused us trouble during the war were not Russians.
Sentence 175: Russia was our ally.
Sentence 176: The spies were Germans and Japanese.
Sentence 177: I have never heard anything about a search for them.
Sentence 178: They were our enemies, if I remember correctly.
Sentence 179: Q.
Sentence 180: That's a pretty good quote, "a lie out of the whole cloth."
Sentence 181: What about it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: Go ahead, quote it.
Sentence 183: It's true.
Sentence 184: It's also a plain lie.
Sentence 185: I never protected a disloyal person in my life.
Sentence 186: Q.
Sentence 187: It's the quote which makes the statement.
Sentence 188: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 189: Make it a quote.
Sentence 190: It's all right.
Sentence 191: You can use it.
Sentence 192: Q.
Sentence 193: May we quote "just a plain lie"?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 194: A lie out of the whole cloth, that's what it is, just a lie out of the whole cloth.
Sentence 195: I could give it an adjective, but you wouldn't print it.
Sentence 196: [Laughter]
Sentence 197: [15.]
Sentence 198: Q. Mr. President, do you know of any crisis facing the United States on the domestic scene today?
Sentence 199: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 200: No, I don't know of any serious crisis facing the United States on the domestic scene.
Sentence 201: I haven't been informed of one.
Sentence 202: Q. Is that the first time in 8 years?
Sentence 203: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 204: Oh, I--no, I wouldn't say that.
Sentence 205: I wouldn't say that.
Sentence 206: [16.]
Sentence 207: Q. Mr. President, I think you could get the adjective printed where no one else could.
Sentence 208: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 209: Well, you know what it is.
Sentence 210: [17.]
Sentence 211: Q. Mr. President, won't continually rising prices become a crisis?
Sentence 212: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 213: They will be, eventually, if they keep on climbing.
Sentence 214: They can cause a serious crisis.
Sentence 215: [18.]
Sentence 216: Q. Do you want to enlarge on what you have already said about the garbage thrown at Mr. Wallace in the South?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 217: I made a statement on that through Mr. Ross which covers the situation completely, and that statement still stands.
Sentence 218: 1
1
On August 31 the President issued a statement through his Press Secretary in which he denounced the hostile reception given to Henry A. Wallace, Progressive Party candidate for President.
Sentence 219: The President said that the rowdy behavior which greeted Mr. Wallace in North Carolina was "contrary to the American spirit of fair play.
Sentence 220: "
Q. Mr. President, do you plan to take any action on the west coast maritime lockout and the truck strike in New York?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 221: Every action possible has been taken in that west coast strike.
Sentence 222: This is the end of the 80th day, and I have no emergency powers.
Sentence 223: There is nothing that can be done now in that strike.
Sentence 224: We have done everything possible and are still trying to settle it by negotiation.
Sentence 225: Q. Mr. President, do you plan to appoint Mr. David Henderson as temporary judge of the western district of North Carolina?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 226: I think that has already been done.
Sentence 227: Q.
Sentence 228: I think there's a temporary appointment recommended for the interim--until the action on the Judge Warlick 2 nomination?
Sentence 229: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 230: I can't answer that, because I don't remember the details.
Sentence 231: I will hunt it up for you and see that you get it, if you are interested.
Sentence 232: Reporter:
Sentence 233: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 234: 2 Wilson Warlick whose name was submitted to the Senate by the President on April 2 for confirmation as District Judge of the Western District of North Carolina.
