SPECULATION IN COMMODITY MARKETS
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: It has come to my knowledge that certain persons are selling short in our commodity markets, particularly in wheat.
Sentence 3: These transactions have been continuous over the past month.
Sentence 4: I do not refer to the ordinary hedging transactions, which are a sound part of our marketing system.
Sentence 5: I do not refer to the legitimate grain trade.
Sentence 6: I refer to a limited number of speculators, and I am not expressing any views upon the economics of short selling in normal times.
Sentence 7: But in these times this activity has a public interest.
Sentence 8: It has but one purpose
Sentence 9: and that is to depress prices.
Sentence 10: It tends to destroy returning public confidence.
Sentence 11: The intent is to take a profit from the losses of other people.
Sentence 12: Even though the effect may be temporary, it deprives many farmers of their rightful income.
Sentence 13: If these gentlemen have that sense of patriotism, which outruns immediate profit, and a desire to see the country recover, they will close up these transactions and desist from their manipulations.
Sentence 14: The confidence imposed upon me by law as a public official does not permit me to expose their names to the public.
