Sentence 1: 1948 The Presidents News Conference 382

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have a statement on the so-called housing bill, which I will read to you, and it will be available for you when you go out.
Sentence 3: [Reading] "I have today signed Senate bill 2790, 'To amend the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended, and for other purposes.'
Sentence 4: 1
1 As enacted, S. 2790 is Public Law 864, 80th Congress (62 Stat. 1206).
Sentence 5: "For reasons which are quite understandable, the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives insisted upon calling this measure a 'housing' bill.
Sentence 6: But as a housing bill, it is, as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Housing truthfully said, 'practically nothing at all.'
Sentence 7: "In this case, as in many others, the Both Congress has failed miserably to meet the urgent needs of the people of the United States.
Sentence 8: I consider it to be the duty of the President to inform the people as to the actual facts on these vital issues.
Sentence 9: That is why I have issued, and shall continue to issue, statements commenting on legislation passed by the Congress.
Sentence 10: "This so-called housing bill is a hasty patchwork.
Sentence 11: It was passed by the Congress in the final hours of the session, after the Republican leadership refused to permit the House of Representatives to vote upon the Taft-Ellender-Wagner housing bill.
Sentence 12: This bill bears no resemblance to the comprehensive housing program included in the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill.
Sentence 13: "It fails to provide for farm housing or for slum clearance.
Sentence 14: "It fails to provide for housing research, for financial assistance to large-scale home construction, or for encouraging large-scale production of prefabricated housing.
Sentence 15: "It fails completely to aid in meeting our greatest housing need--low-cost rental housing.
Sentence 16: It makes no provision for publicly assisted low-rent housing--or, in fact, for any rental housing.
Sentence 17: "Contrasted with the Taft-Ellender-Wagner housing bill, this measure was properly labeled in the Congress as the 'teeny-weeny' housing bill.
Sentence 18: "This bill does two things.
Sentence 19: First, it increases the funds available for the Government purchase of home mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration and restores the authority to purchase mortgages guaranteed under the GI act, which the Congress allowed to lapse in 1947.
Sentence 20: This is the so-called secondary mortgage market, which is designed to encourage the supply of private credit to home buyers.
Sentence 21: Second, the bill purports to liberalize the Government's authority to insure mortgages for veterans' housing cooperatives.
Sentence 22: But even in these respects the bill is seriously defective.
Sentence 23: "With respect to the secondary mortgage market, the bill repeals the present authority of the Government to purchase FHA insured mortgages on rental properties.
Sentence 24: Thus, it actually eliminates an existing aid to urgently needed rental housing.
Sentence 25: "With respect to veterans' housing cooperatives, the bill is practically worthless.
Sentence 26: "It purports to aid veterans' cooperatives by authorizing the Federal Housing Administration to insure 95 percent loans to veterans' housing cooperatives.
Sentence 27: But it does not change the applicable cost limitation of $1,350 per room, established in 1938.
Sentence 28: Since builders are now having difficulty in most areas in constructing rental housing at $ 1,800 per room, a $1,350 cost limitation nullifies, as a practical matter, the legal authority given by this bill to insure loans to veterans' housing cooperatives.
Sentence 29: "There can be no excuse for such slipshod legislation, thrown together only a few hours before adjournment.
Sentence 30: The 80th Congress had ample time to enact the housing legislation the country needs.
Sentence 31: The Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill was pending during the full term of both sessions.
Sentence 32: Exhaustive hearings were held time and time again.
Sentence 33: But the Republican leadership would not even give the House of Representatives a chance to vote on it.
Sentence 34: "The failure to pass decent housing legislation is a sad disappointment to the millions of our people who are so desperately in need of homes, and to the many Members of Congress who tried so hard to break the stranglehold of the little group of men who blocked a decent housing bill.
Sentence 35: "We cannot accept as final a decision reached by such undemocratic methods.
Sentence 36: "This is one of the many jobs left unfinished by the 80th Congress.
Sentence 37: "
I am ready for questions.
