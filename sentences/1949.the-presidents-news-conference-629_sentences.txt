Sentence 133: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 137: I have no further comment to make on it.
Sentence 138: [18.]
Sentence 139: Q. Mr. President, from the words you used and the tone of your voice on that reorganization answer, I take it that you are in favor of a good, strict hundred percent reorganization?
Sentence 140: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 141: I hope that will be the case, because if the President's hands tied, from experience I know that there will be no reorganization.
Sentence 142: I am hoping that this time we will get something constructive and effective, so we can make things more efficiently--work more efficiently in the executive branch of the Government.
Sentence 143: I think everybody's interested in that.
Sentence 144: I have said once before here at a press conference that everybody has their pet that I am afraid is going to get to work around it somewhere.

Sentence 151: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 152: I invited Mr. Stalin here to Washington, in Potsdam when I was there, add I have restated that I will be glad to see him here any time he wants to come.

Sentence 154: Q. Yes, sir.
Sentence 155: May I just put one further question?
Sentence 156: If Stalin, for example, were to be willing to come to, say Alaska, would you be--

Sentence 181: [23.]
Sentence 182: Q. Mr. President, have you asked Mrs. Truman to get the guest room ready at the Blair House for Mr. Stalin?
Sentence 183: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 184: I haven't any notification that he is coming.
