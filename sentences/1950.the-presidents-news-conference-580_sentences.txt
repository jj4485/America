Sentence 23: Q. Mr. President, yesterday you issued an Executive order on the dissemination of information, and in it, in the last paragraph, you include military documents and reports which have been marked "Confidential" and "Restricted"--also "Top Secret" and "Secret," etc.
Sentence 24: That classification "Restricted" is one of the most general I have ever seen.
Sentence 25: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 26: It is exactly a copy of the order that has been in effect all the time, and the only reason that order was issued was that it conform with the new Defense Act.
Sentence 27: There isn't any difference with this order and the one that has been in effect

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 32: --that the order conform with the new law on the Defense Act.
Sentence 33: Unification--it's an order to conform with the Unification Act.
Sentence 34: That's all there is to it.
Sentence 35: That order has been in effect ever since I have been President.
Sentence 36: Q. Is there any way to get a definition of "Restricted," so that the Army officers would know what it means?
Sentence 37: In some places it refers to clippings.
Sentence 38: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 39: I can't answer the question.
Sentence 40: You will have to talk to somebody that uses "Restricted."
Sentence 41: I don't use it.
Sentence 42: [Laughter]
Q. Well, every office boy seems to stamp "Restricted" or "Confidential," and I have seen many "Confidential" and "Restricted" documents which had no reason whatever to be--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 43: You never saw one come out with my signature on it.
Sentence 44: [Laughter] You talk to them, now.
Sentence 45: That's their business not mine.
Sentence 46: Those "Restricted" documents are mostly military.
Sentence 47: [4.]

Sentence 56: That order speaks for itself.
Sentence 57: You can put your own interpretation on it.

Q.
Sentence 60: What?
Q.
Sentence 61: The North Pole--North Pole.
Sentence 62: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: A picture of the North Pole marked "Restricted."
Sentence 64: I can't comment on that, though.
Sentence 65: Take it up with the Attorney General or the military which is responsible.
Sentence 66: Q.
Sentence 67: There is pretty much confusion about what we can write and what we can't.

Sentence 76: [7.]
Sentence 77: Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on the present crisis relating to the surplus of potatoes?
Sentence 78: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: I think the lady from Maine ought to know more about potatoes than anybody in the United States.
Sentence 80: She ought to understand that this farm act which was amended last year puts us in the position to place those potatoes in the condition in which they are.
Sentence 81: And that whole thing is a sectional thing, and for the benefit of the potato growers of Maine as well as the other potato growers in the United States; but that is how it came about.
Sentence 82: I suggest you talk to Senator Brewster about it.
Sentence 83: Q. Half the surplus, I understand, is scattered all over the country.
Sentence 84: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 87: That's right.
Sentence 88: [8.]
Sentence 89: Q. Mr. President, would the Chief of Naval Operations have the authority to decide whether the Missouri should be replaced by an airplane carrier, or would that be entirely up to you?

Sentence 91: The Secretary of the Navy has the right to make that order, if he so chooses.
Sentence 92: [9.]

Sentence 102: Oh, I know it is a book by a gentleman named Major General Truman.
Sentence 103: [Laughter] He made the first Truman report to the United States President of 1869.
Sentence 104: And it was on the reconstruction of the South.
Sentence 105: And while I was in the Senate, when I got out my first report as chairman of that Committee, Mr. Halsey who was then the Secretary of the Senate, hunted up this old Truman report.
Sentence 106: It is most interesting.
Sentence 107: Q. Mr. President, was that top secret then?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 109: [10.]
Sentence 110: Q. Mr. President, will the battleship Missouri be taken out of service?

Sentence 115: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 116: I have no comment on Senator Vandenberg's statement, but for your information we have urged constantly that international control be accepted by all the nations of the world.
Sentence 117: Hardly a week goes by that that matter is not brought up, at my suggestion, in the United Nations.
Sentence 118: [12.]
Sentence 119: Q. Mr. President, in your first answer on FEPC do you mean that you have asked the Speaker to recognize--

Sentence 121: I talk to him about it every Monday morning.
Sentence 122: Q.
Sentence 123: You have asked him to recognize Lesinski?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 124: No, I didn't ask him to recognize anybody.
Sentence 125: I asked him to consider the passage of FEPG in both Houses.
Sentence 126: I didn't ask him to recognize anybody.
Sentence 127: That's the business of the Speaker.
Sentence 128: He has been in charge of that, and nobody can tell him whom to recognize.
Sentence 129: [13.]
Sentence 130: Q. Mr. President, I have a pro forma thing, if nothing else.
Sentence 131: Do you think notification to the United Nations of the new superbomb project is necessary or advisable?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 152: Jack will give it to you.
Sentence 153: Mr. Romagna [reading]: "That the Republican Party should be an organization that is broad and not exclusive
Q. Mr. President, maybe I'd better read it from this: "That the Republican Party should be an organization that is broad and not exclusive, a party of service and not of privilege, a party that is hard-hitting and not timid, a party that is progressive and not backsliding, a party that is constructive and not petty.
Sentence 154: "

Q. Mr. President, can we--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 158: Wait a minute--I promised to answer him--I promised to answer his question.
Sentence 159: Q.
Sentence 160: Do you think the Governor has done a good job describing the Democratic Party?
Sentence 161: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 162: The Democratic Party is the sort of party he describes.
Sentence 163: Now what was that question back there?
Sentence 164: Q.

Sentence 179: Q. Mr. President, do you like the new proposed amendment to revise the electoral system?
11
THE PRESIDENT,
Sentence 180: Well, I ordinarily don't comment on any legislation that is pending, but you know a constitutional amendment is not a matter that the President passes on, it is passed by two-thirds vote of both Houses.
Sentence 181: And then it is sent to be ratified by threefourths of the States.
Sentence 182: 11
On January 5, 1949, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., of Massachusetts, and 11 other Senators introduced S.J. Res. 2, proposing an amendment to the Constitution changing the method of electing the President and Vice President.
Sentence 183: Under the proposed amendment all presidential candidates would share the electoral votes of each State in proportion to the number of popular votes that they had received.
Sentence 184: The candidate receiving the most electoral votes, providing that he had obtained more than 40 percent of the total, would be elected.

Sentence 188: On July 17, 1950, the House voted 134-210 against bringing the bill to the floor, and the proposed amendment expired with the 81st Congress.
Sentence 189: I think that this resolution that was passed by the Senate yesterday is a forward step.
Sentence 190: I was very much interested in it.
Sentence 191: I have read all the records and all the hearings on it; and I made some suggestions myself on the thing, most of which were adopted.
Sentence 192: And I believe it would be a step in the right direction if the States choose to ratify the constitutional amendment.
Sentence 193: It takes 36 States to ratify an amendment.
Sentence 194: But I would advise you to read the hearings on that, they are most interesting.
Sentence 195: You will find more about elections and presidential history that you never heard of before, if you haven't read it.
Sentence 196: [19.]
Sentence 197: Q. Mr. President, in the proposition to the coal operators and John L. Lewis,
12
you ask for a return to normal production.
Sentence 198: Would you care to say whether that requires a 5-day week, or less?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 199: I asked for normal production under the reinstatement of contract.
Sentence 200: The contract itself sets that out.
Sentence 201: 12 See Item 27
Q.
Sentence 202: Mr. President, that means--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 203: You will have to translate that yourselves.
Sentence 204: In some places they can't work a full week on account of the local situation.
Sentence 205: Now that applies all over the United States.

Sentence 215: Q. Mr. President, I am not trying to heckle you on this
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 217: Try your best; you can't heckle me.
Sentence 218: Go ahead.
Sentence 219: [Laughter]
Q. Well, in any case, sir, we are forced to rely on gossip and so-called White House circles, and things like that, to determine what caused you to reach your decision to produce the superbomb?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 220: The statement that I released covers the ground so far as I expect to go with it.
Sentence 221: Q.
Sentence 222: Do you--you wouldn't care, sir, to elaborate--I mean--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 223: No.
Sentence 224: No, I have no further statement to make except the one that was released.
Sentence 225: Q. Mr. President, Senator McMahon has indicated that he is about to make a speech asking for a nationwide public discussion of the issues raised by the superbomb.

Sentence 228: [21.]
Sentence 229: Q. Mr. President, do you plan to send up your message on the New England public power program pretty soon?
