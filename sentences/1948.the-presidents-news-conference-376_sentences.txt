Sentence 19: [3.]
Sentence 20: Q. Mr. President, at this moment the Attorney General is discussing new laws with the House Un-American Activities Committee, and I wonder whether, in drawing up the message on civil rights, whether the White House considered protection of Americans against smearing and things of that sort that have been talked about commonly in some committees in Congress?

Sentence 41: [6.]
Sentence 42: Q. Mr. President, what do you think the proposed cut in your budget would do to it?
Sentence 43: The House and Senate subcommittee has recommended lopping $2 1/2 billion off of it.
Sentence 44: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 45: It seems to me that I heard a question like that last year, about what they were going to do to my budget.
Sentence 46: I asked for an expenditure of--I asked for an authorization for 37,500 millions, and then when the budget was finally wound up, it ended up with 37,700 million, which showed that it was a tight, well-organized budget.
Sentence 47: This budget is exactly the same sort.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 56: Well now, you can't seem to get it off your mind.
Sentence 57: I will tell you what happened.
Sentence 58: I have countless invitations for appearances at various meetings in nearly every State in the Union.
Sentence 59: Every President has that.
Sentence 60: And the ones that we were discussing as to whether I should make an appearance were not political gatherings at all.
Sentence 61: And it was--no decision was reached as to whether I should appear at any of them or not.
Sentence 62: I have got more than I can do sitting right here at this desk, but sometimes we need a change of scenery, and the newspapermen need a ride--[ Laughter ]--so
Sentence 63: we have a party of that sort, once in a while.
Sentence 64: Q. Mr. President, we are not going to have a revival of inspection trips, are we?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 65: Well, there's nothing to inspect right now.
Sentence 66: If a war was going on and we needed inspection trips, we would take them.
Sentence 67: I took many a one during the war.
Sentence 68: I think I traveled one hundred thousand miles on inspection trips during the war, and they were necessary.

Sentence 74: They said they had authorization from you to make those announcements.

Sentence 82: When it appears.
Sentence 83: That is another if, as, and when problem.
Sentence 84: Q. Will you support the party nominee?
Sentence 85: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 86: Certainly.
Sentence 87: I always have.
Sentence 88: Q. Well, Mr. President, when we had Senator McGrath on the "Meet the Press," he slipped up and said that he was going to reelect Mr. Truman.
Sentence 89: We said how did he know, and he said he had a hunch.
Sentence 90: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: Well, that was a good hunch, I think.
Sentence 92: Q.
Sentence 93: You have a hunch?
Sentence 94: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 95: I have no hunches.
Sentence 96: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 97: You have no hunches?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 98: I have no hunches.

Sentence 106: [11.]

Sentence 108: What do you think about the behavior of the commodity and stock markets?
Sentence 109: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 111: I can't make any comment on that at the present time.
Sentence 112: [12.]
Sentence 113: Q. Mr. President, are you still hopeful for meat control or rationing of any sort?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 114: I am still in the same frame of mind that I was when I sent the anti-inflationary recommendations to the Congress.
Sentence 115: I feel just as I did at that time.
Sentence 116: That was in the message of November 17.1
1 see 1947 volume, this series, Item 224.
Sentence 117: Q.
Sentence 118: As to the necessity?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 119: As to the absolute necessity.
Sentence 120: I think it's shown that--if you are interested in the situation, I have here a new--I just happened to get from the Budget a new table on the situation--[ showing them]--which goes to show what has happened since that message went down.
Sentence 121: That message went down about--at this point here--[indicating]--and you see now they have had to put another block on this thing here, in order to get to the top.
Sentence 122: Q. Is that on the price rise?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 123: Yes, that's the price rise.
Sentence 124: Notice, since they weakened rent control, what's happening to the rents.
Sentence 125: They have started on the same sort of a spiral that the rest of these things have taken, after controls were taken off.
Sentence 126: Q.
Sentence 127: What are those lines, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 128: This black line here is on commodities.
Sentence 129: The dotted line is food, and the other is clothing.
Sentence 130: It is a most interesting study.
Sentence 131: Every month I get a rehash of this price situation, and it really is alarming.
Sentence 132: Q. Mr. President, did the Budget Bureau put that out?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 133: Yes.
Sentence 134: Yes.
Sentence 135: They prepared this for me in the Bureau--in conjunction with other bureaus interested in the question.
Sentence 136: Q. Mr. President, the purpose of that chart shows, does it not, sir, that all prices-cost of living prices--have gone up since your message.
Sentence 137: Is that correct?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 138: Yes.
Sentence 139: Yes.
Sentence 140: Very definitely.
Sentence 141: Q. Is that food, clothing, and commodities?
Sentence 142: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 143: Yes, everything.
Sentence 144: Sure enough.
Sentence 145: Q. Mr. President, does it show an increase in incomes, too?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 146: No, this does not have anything to do with incomes.
Sentence 147: It is--I spoke of income, if you remember, in the Message on the State of the Union.
Sentence 148: The suggestion was made in the Budget Message on skimming off some of that cream at the top in profits.
Sentence 149: Q. Are you going to make any new appeals to Congress on imposing price controls?
Sentence 150: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 151: I am going to keep telling Congress just what the situation is, and the Congress will have to act itself.
Sentence 152: They have this information the same as I have.
Sentence 153: They know what is going on.
Sentence 154: Q. Mr. President, the continuing argument against price control and rationing is that it will--kills production.
Sentence 155: Have you--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 156: I don't think--I think that is a bad approach to the thing, because it didn't happen.
Sentence 157: It didn't happen when we had price control.
Sentence 158: Production was ample under price control to meet the situation.
Sentence 159: And I think that if we don't find some way to stop this awful spiral with which we are faced, we will go to the logical conclusion, which is to come down in a crash; and that we don't want to see.
Sentence 160: [13.]
Sentence 161: Q. Mr. President, the British have been asked for no more wage increases or profits increases unless there are corresponding increases in production.
Sentence 162: Does that seem a good way to meet inflation?
Sentence 163: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 164: I think if you will read my anti-inflation message of November 17, it will--your question will be answered.
Sentence 165: [14.]
Sentence 166: Q. Mr. President, do you see merit in Henry Wallace's suggestion that all presidential candidates disavow support of parties or individuals who advocate violent overthrow of the Government, or who advocate white supremacy?
Sentence 167: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 168: I have no comment to make on that question.
Sentence 169: Reporter:
Sentence 170: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 171: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 172: You're welcome.
