THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 17: It doesn't make any difference.
Sentence 18: We have been putting them down.

Sentence 23: Q. Yes, sir.
Sentence 24: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 29: [2.]
Sentence 30: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us anything about Mr. Harriman's report to you yesterday, after his return from the Far East?

What he said was substantially what he had reported to me.
Sentence 33: 2
W. Averell Harriman, special foreign coordinator for President Truman, stated in a press conference on August 9 that United States policy toward Formosa had been set by Mr. Truman on June 27 and that this policy had not been changed since that time (see Item 173).

Sentence 40: 3
See Item 196.
Sentence 41: Q. Mr. President, they didn't send them to us.
Sentence 42: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 43: Well, it was not a public document, but everything of that kind leaks, and a good one ought to leak once in a while.
Sentence 44: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 45: It didn't.
Sentence 46: Mr. Ross: Mr. President, that was made public.
Sentence 47: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 48: That was made public, Charlie says.
Sentence 49: [Laughter] You probably didn't keep up with the bandwagon.
Sentence 50: I thought it had been.
Sentence 51: But if it hadn't, it could very easily have leaked.
Sentence 52: [4.]
Sentence 53: Q. Did you reply to the telegram of the railroad unions before the Government takes possession of the railroads?

Sentence 76: Q. Mr. President, we have had conflicting reports on the excess profits tax.
Sentence 77: Some of your friends are saying that you want an excess profits tax now, and that you do not want one as of now.
Sentence 78: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: Well, I will tell you just exactly what the situation is.
Sentence 80: As in the case of the request for controls, I asked for a tax that I hoped could be promptly enacted.
Sentence 81: An excess profits tax is a very controversial matter.
Sentence 82: Of course, eventually, there will be an excess profits tax, but the Congress ought to have plenty of time to work it out when they haven't the election jitters.
Sentence 83: And I think it railroads in the United States until such time as this dispute is settled in fairness to the rights of our members."
Sentence 84: See also Item 221.
Sentence 85: would be better to work that out after the election than now.
Sentence 86: If they will act promptly on the tax I asked for, it will help, to some extent, with this inflationary spiral with which we have been threatened.

Sentence 90: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: Of course.
Sentence 92: [9.]

5

Sentence 98: You are not unhappy, though?
Sentence 99: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 102: [10.]
Sentence 103: Q. Mr. President, the Senate Finance Committee tabled the bill to suspend the import tax on copper.
Sentence 104: Are you still as optimistic, that Congress--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 105: I think that is something that really ought to be done.
Sentence 106: It is helpful to our allies, and it will help our relations in the American hemisphere.
Sentence 107: That tax ought never to have been put on there in the first place.
Sentence 108: They should not have let it expire.

Sentence 120: [12.]
Sentence 121: Q. Mr. President, you have said that you will carry on mobilization with the old-line agencies, and if so, what is your thinking on that?
Sentence 122: Why do you favor that, rather than setting up new administrative functions?
Sentence 123: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 124: I have been spending the last 5 years improving the administrative setup of the Federal Government, by reorganization plans and in other ways.
Sentence 125: We have an excellent and efficient administrative setup in the Federal Government, and there is no reason in the world why it can't operate successfully under all conditions.
Sentence 126: Q. Mr. President, then I take it that you mean it wouldn't be a revival of OPA?

Sentence 129: [13.]
Sentence 130: Q. Mr. President, Trygve Lie, in his report on the United Nations, said that the real crisis would come after we had won the Korean war--that is, a crisis in world affairs; and he recommended high level meetings between the East and West to solve that crisis.
Sentence 131: Are you in favor of such meetings?
Sentence 132: Do you think they would be useful?
Sentence 133: THE PRESIDENT, I am in favor of anything that will contribute to the peace of the world.
Sentence 134: Q. May I be more specific then, sir?
Sentence 135: If Trygve Lie were to take the initiative of suggesting such a meeting, would it have the approval of the United States Government?

Sentence 138: [14.]
Sentence 139: Q. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago you told us that you felt wage and price controls and manpower allocations could come all at the same time as a part of total mobilization?
Sentence 140: You said at that time it was not in sight--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 141: That is correct--not yet.
Sentence 142: Q.
Sentence 143: It has not come in sight yet?
Sentence 144: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: No.
Q.
Sentence 146: Mr. President, in that connection, the Senate and House Banking Committees apparently want to give you selective powers, if they are necessary.
Sentence 147: I understand the House is planning to take that, and I think the Senate wants to.
Sentence 148: Will you express an opinion or comment on that?
Sentence 149: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: The House and Senate must legislate and put the matter up to me, and then I will comment on it.
Sentence 151: I have asked them for exactly what I want, very specifically.
Sentence 152: [15.]
Sentence 153: Q. Mr. President, from those questions, it seems to me to bring up the old matter of another meeting between the heads of states?

Sentence 156: Q. I wanted to make that clear.
Sentence 157: Q. Mr. President, you make a distinction between possibly high level meetings and meetings between heads of states?
Sentence 158: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 159: That's correct--that's correct.
Sentence 160: [16.]
Sentence 161: Q. Mr. President, in connection with all-out mobilization, if there were need for control of transportation, could we take your answers to mean that you might use an agency like the Interstate Commerce Commission?
Sentence 162: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 163: I certainly would.
Sentence 164: [17.]
Sentence 165: Q. Mr. President, I believe we mentioned awhile ago the rejection of Martin Hutchinson.
Sentence 166: I wonder if you have any comment on the four rejections by the Senate
6
--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: No, I have no comment.
Sentence 168: Senatorial courtesy still works.
Sentence 169: 6 Four of President Truman's nominees for Federal office were rejected by the Senate on August 9: Frank E. Hook to the Motor Carrier Claims Commission, Martin A. Hutchinson to the Federal Trade Commission, and two Federal judges already sitting under "recess" appointments, Judges M. Neil Andrews of the Northern District of Georgia and Carroll O.

Sentence 170: [18.]
Sentence 171: Q. Mr. President, it is only a little over 5 years ago that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.

Sentence 175: [19.]
Sentence 176: Q. Mr. President, I might have missed this--I might not have heard.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 178: Will you repeat that--will you repeat that, please?
Sentence 179: I didn't get it.
Sentence 180: Q.
Sentence 181: Do you think that any good would come now of a meeting between the heads of states--of Russia and the Western Powers?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: The United Nations is set up for that, for the purpose to which you refer.
Sentence 183: The United Nations Security Council is in session, and the Assembly will be in session in a very short time.
Sentence 184: That is the place for these things to be taken up.
Sentence 185: [20.]
Sentence 186: Q. Mr. President, you referred to the Russian conduct in the United Nations as a filibuster, but--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 187: Yes, that is correct.
Sentence 188: Q.--do you care to say what they are filibustering against?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 189: Themselves principally, I think.
Sentence 190: [21.]
Sentence 191: Q. I wanted to ask, have you heard anything from Mr. Steelman

on the progress of the mediation--conferences with the railroad and union heads?
Sentence 192: THE PRESIDENT.
