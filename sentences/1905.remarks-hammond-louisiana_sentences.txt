Sentence 1: 1905 Remarks Hammond Louisiana

My fellow citizens and residents of Louisiana:
I am glad of this opportunity of telling you how proud I am to be within the borders of the great State of Louisiana, so rich in glorious traditions.
Sentence 2: It has been my intention to pay you a visit for a long time, but it would seem that circumstances have only lately been so as to make my visit possible.
Sentence 3: I wanted to come long ago, and indeed I would have come if I could have been of any use, but you have done all that was necessary.
Sentence 4: Let me express to you my pleasure at knowing that you have worked conscientiously through the long summer months, for which such splendid results show today.
Sentence 5: Louisiana was never found wanting when the time came to act.
Sentence 6: You have followed traditions of earlier years, such as were set down by the men, some of whom I see before me now, who wore the blue.
Sentence 7: I am glad to be able to look into your faces and to feel that you have done your duty.
