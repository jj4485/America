Sentence 25: Q. Mr. President, there is a bill, I believe, on the Senate calendar, to implement the Hoover recommendations.
Sentence 26: Do you have any intention of asking for that reform--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 27: The reorganization bill is the one that has to be passed before we can do anything with those things--with that Hoover recommendation, except those that require legislation; and legislation has been asked, in those instances.
Sentence 28: Q.
Sentence 29: The general bill on the Senate calendar is the one I had in mind.
Sentence 30: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 31: That is the reorganization bill ?
Sentence 32: Q. Yes.
Sentence 33: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 34: Well, I can't force the Senate to pass it.
Sentence 35: I have asked the "Big Four"
2
every Monday morning how soon they are going to pass the reorganization bill, and they always say right away; but if they don't pass it right away we won't have any business to do, I can tell you that, because that-you have just 60 days for the Congress to act when the reorganization plan goes up.
Sentence 36: With less than 60 days now, and Congress hasn't time to act, why of course it doesn't apply and you have to do it all over again next year.

Sentence 43: Q. Mr. President, in your speech to the farm radio directors,
3
you said it doesn't make much difference what prices are so long as there is a balance between the three groups that is fair, the three groups being the farmer, processor, etc.
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: That is quite clear.
Sentence 45: 3
See Item 90.
Sentence 46: Q.
Sentence 47: What do you mean "doesn't make much difference what prices are"?
Sentence 48: Couldn't prices go too high?
Sentence 49: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 50: So that the distribution of the products themselves is on a fair basis, so that every part and segment of the population get their fair share at a price they can afford to pay.
Sentence 51: That doesn't make any difference about the prices.
Sentence 52: That means that the situation should be balanced so that farm prices, labor prices, consumer prices are equal.
Sentence 53: Q.
Sentence 54: Yes, but what happens to the people with fixed incomes?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: That's what I am talking about when I say the consumer.
Sentence 56: Q. I mean, are you going to have a balance between farmer and consumer prices--
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 58: That is what we are after.
Sentence 59: That is what we have been working for ever since I have been in the Senate.
Sentence 60: That is what parity means.
Sentence 61: Q.
Sentence 62: Yes.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: Yes, you can't tell one from another.
Sentence 65: Q.
Sentence 66: You have to take the fixed income group, and everybody else.

Sentence 75: Do you believe that, or do you believe--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: I have no comment on that.
Sentence 77: I don't know on what General Clay bases his statement, so I can't comment on it.
Sentence 78: Q.
Sentence 79: It was his farewell press conference.
Sentence 80: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: I have said all I had to say on the subject.
Sentence 82: [7.]

Sentence 106: [10.]
Sentence 107: Q. Mr. President, I was going to ask, there is a report on the Hill that there might be a joint session of the Congress on May 19th to honor the President of Brazil.

6
