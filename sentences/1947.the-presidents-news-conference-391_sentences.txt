Sentence 8: We must all respect its provisions.
Sentence 9: "For my part, I want to make it unmistakably clear that, insofar as it lies within my power as President, I shall see that this law is well and faithfully administered.

Sentence 11: "The persons who are to be appointed to the new offices created under the act will be selected with the same objective.
Sentence 12: I regard it as of the utmost importance that persons be selected for these offices who have the confidence of management and labor, and who can be depended upon to deal fairly with both.
Sentence 13: Above all, they should understand the paramount interest of the Nation as a whole.
Sentence 14: "Insofar as management and labor are concerned, there is a vital responsibility upon them to comply with the law in a spirit of tolerance and fair play.
Sentence 15: Neither management nor labor will achieve any long-range benefit by seeking to use the provisions of this act to gain unfair advantage or to sustain arbitrary attitudes.
Sentence 16: It is in the interests of both to maintain steady production at fair wages while the effect of the new act is being tested by experience.
Sentence 17: At this time, as at all others, they will serve their mutual welfare best by working together with full recognition by each of the legitimate rights of the other.
Sentence 18: "I call upon labor and management, therefore, to exercise patience and moderation in accommodating themselves to the changes made necessary by the act.
Sentence 19: "Industrial strife at this critical time can result only in economic dislocation injurious to all of us.
Sentence 20: If it should reach serious proportions it would threaten the stability of our economy and endanger the peace of the world.
