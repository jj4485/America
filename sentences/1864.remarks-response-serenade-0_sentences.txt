FELLOW-CITIZENS:
Sentence 2: I was promised not to be called upon for a speech to-night, nor do I propose to make one.
Sentence 3: But, as we have been hearing some very good news for a day or two, I propose that you give three hearty cheers for Sheridan.
Sentence 4: While we are at it we may as well consider how fortunate it was for the Secesh that Sheridan was a very little man.
Sentence 5: If he had been a large man, there is no knowing what he would have done with them.
Sentence 6: I propose three cheers for General Grant, who knew to what use to put Sheridan; three cheers for all our noble commanders and the soldiers and sailors; three cheers for all people everywhere who cheer the soldiers and sailors of the Union---and now, good night.
