Sentence 1: 1903 Remarks Modesto California

Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am very glad to catch this glimpse of you.
Sentence 2: I have passed four delightful days in your mountains up there in the Yosemite and I cannot say how much I have enjoyed them, but I have enjoyed even more my entire trip through California and the courtesy and hospitality with which I have been received.
Sentence 3: It has been a great pleasure to me to come from the East to the West, then west of the West to California, and to see your wonderful State.
Sentence 4: And while I have enjoyed it all, enjoyed seeing the soil and the climate, enjoyed witnessing the abounding prosperity that you have succeeded in making, the thing that I have enjoyed most has been seeing the men and women, the citizens of California, for that is what counts most in the long run.
Sentence 5: The soil and the climate will not count for anything if the people have not got it in them to take advantage of the soil and climate.
Sentence 6: I think I came to California a middling good American
Sentence 7: and I will go away a better American.
Sentence 8: It has been the greatest pleasure to see you all.
Sentence 9: [
Applause
