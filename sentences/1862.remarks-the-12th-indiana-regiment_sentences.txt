Sentence 1: 1862 Remarks The 12Th Indiana Regiment

SOLDIERS, OF THE TWELFTH INDIANA REGIMENT:
Sentence 2: It has not been customary heretofore, nor will it be hereafter, for me to say something to every regiment passing in review.
Sentence 3: It occurs too frequently for me to have speeches ready on all occasions.
Sentence 4: As you have paid such a mark of respect to the chief magistrate, it appears that I should say a word or two in reply.
Sentence 5: Your colonel has thought fit, on his own account and in your name, to say that you are satisfied with the manner in which I have performed my part in the difficulties which have surrounded the nation.
Sentence 6: For your kind expressions I am extremely grateful, but on the other hand I assure you that the nation is more indebted to you, and such as you, than to me.
Sentence 7: It is upon the brave hearts and strong arms of the people of the country that our reliance has been placed in support of free government and free institutions.
Sentence 8: For the part which you and the brave army of which you are a part have, under Providence, performed in this great struggle, I tender more thanks especially to this regiment, which has been the subject of good report.
Sentence 9: The thanks of the nation will follow you, and may God's blessing rest upon you now and forever.
Sentence 10: I hope that upon your return to your homes you will find your friends and loved ones well and happy.
Sentence 11: I bid you farewell.
