Sentence 1: 1929 The Presidents News Conference 886

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I haven't any very alarming questions today.
Sentence 3: I have one as to the tax reduction, on which I have said before I could not make answer until we knew more about the budget situation.
Sentence 4: BUDGET ALLOCATIONS FOR INDEPENDENT ESTABLISHMENTS
Sentence 5: I think it may interest you to have the final budget allocations for the independent establishments.
Sentence 6: That is as far as the budget has progressed for 1931.
Sentence 7: I am having the table mimeographed, so you will have it immediately after the conference.
Sentence 8: The independent establishments embrace both the Farm Board and the Budget Bureau.
Sentence 9: The total amount available for the current fiscal year for all of the establishments is $808,689,000 as you will see by this statement, and in that is $151,500,000 for the Farm Board.
Sentence 10: The budget allocations for the next fiscal year, that is 1931, are $656,571,000, but there is no provision for the Farm Board there, as the Farm Board has not yet been able to make an estimate.
Sentence 11: So the comparisons are a little confused.
Sentence 12: The actual expenditures for the last fiscal year on the independent establishments were $663,300,000.
Sentence 13: During the current year it would be about $650 million if the Farm Board item were taken out, and the estimate for the next year is $656 million, as I have stated, which shows about a $6 million increase which lies almost entirely in the Veterans Bureau.
Sentence 14: But you will have the table in a minute.
Sentence 15: Q. Mr. President, is the District of Columbia included in that ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 16: I don't think so.
Sentence 17: No, the District budget is not in it.
Sentence 18: This is the independent establishments.
Sentence 19: PUBLIC LAND COMMISSION APPOINTMENTS
I have one or two other very minor questions.
Sentence 20: The Public Land Commission is not yet appointed.
Sentence 21: We have the suggestions in from the Governors and Senators, and that is being gone into.
Sentence 22: SAN FRANCISCO BRIDGE COMMISSION
Sentence 23: On the question of the Bridge Commission in San Francisco, that Commission is to meet on the 6th of October in San Francisco.
Sentence 24: ENTERTAINMENT OF PRIME MINISTER MACDONALD
I have another question as to what entertainment is to be given to Mr. MacDonald at the White House.
Sentence 25: From the purely personal [p.306] point of view, there will be a dinner to ladies and gentlemen to the utmost capacity of the White House, on Monday night--probably 90 people.
Sentence 26: That is all I have.
Sentence 27: NEWS CONFERENCE SESSIONS
I wonder sometimes whether when we have a thin day it is worth your while to come--whether we could not hand your questions over to Mr. Akerson, or whether you prefer to come.
Sentence 28: If you would rather have the open session I am entirely agreeable, but I always feel that I am not assisting you as much as I should like when we have a thin day like this.
Sentence 29: Q.
Sentence 30: I think, Mr. President, we prefer the open session.
