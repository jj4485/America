Sentence 96: Q. Would you care to tell us if Governor Wallgren is among those that you are considering
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: Governor Wallgren would make a fine Secretary, but I can't possibly have two Cabinet officers from the great State of Washington.

Sentence 99: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: Well, you draw your own conclusions.
Sentence 101: Q.

Sentence 110: [14.]
Sentence 111: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 112: Now, wait a minute, I want to show you something I think you will enjoy.
Sentence 113: Lieutenant General Richardson showed me some GI drawings that are rather unusual, due to the fact that they are drawn apparently by artists who believe in an infinite ability for taking pains.
Sentence 114: They are not "dogs."
Sentence 115: [Showing some large drawings] These are soldier drawings that were sent me.
Sentence 116: They are, I think, most remarkable.
Sentence 117: I thought maybe you would like to see them.
Sentence 118: These young artists ought to be complemented, because they do not belong to the "ham and egg" class of artists-[laughter]--which--.
Sentence 119: Look at this--[indicating]--don't you think those are wonderful?
Sentence 120: Q. Are they all drawn by one man?

Sentence 124: What was that?
Sentence 125: I didn't hear it.
Sentence 126: Q.
Sentence 127: What do you define as "ham and egg" in art?
Sentence 128: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 129: These so-called pictures that look as if they had stood off and thrown an egg at them--smeared them--[laughter].
Sentence 130: These young men don't belong in that class.
Sentence 131: They still believe that there is--a good deal depends on careful work, and trying to make you see what they intend you to see, and not leave it to your imagination.
Sentence 132: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, is there a moral in that--an implied--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 133: Draw your own conclusions.
Sentence 134: [More laughter] I believe in infinite taking of pains in anything you try to do.
Sentence 135: Q.
Sentence 136: May we quote that, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 137: Yes.
Sentence 138: [15.]
Sentence 139: Q. There is still confusion in my mind.
Sentence 140: You said you can't have two members of the Cabinet from one State . .
Sentence 141: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 142: I didn't say I couldn't have.
Sentence 143: I said I didn't think I should have.
Sentence 144: Q.
Sentence 145: You said that Douglas is a legal resident of Washington?
Sentence 146: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 147: That's right.
Sentence 148: Q. Mr. President, that has added up to four--twice now.
Sentence 149: [Laughter]
Q. Does that--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: Shall we start over?
Sentence 151: I say, shall we start over?
Sentence 152: Q. Does that exclude Douglas ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 153: No.
Sentence 154: It does not exclude Mort Wallgren, either.
Sentence 155: Q.
Sentence 156: You wouldn't do something you shouldn't, would you ?
Sentence 157: Q.
Sentence 158: You said you discussed it with Justice Douglas?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 159: That's right.
Sentence 160: Q. Were you aware then that he was from Washington?
Sentence 161: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 162: Oh yes.
Sentence 163: I know all about Justice Douglas.
Sentence 164: [Laughter] He is a friend of mine--for a long time.
Sentence 165: Q.
Sentence 166: When you discussed it with him, were you discussing the position for Douglas or for someone else?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: I will answer that question later.
Sentence 168: Q.
Sentence 169: The implication is that Mr. Schwellenbach is leaving?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 170: Mr. Schwellenbach is going to stay Secretary of Labor.
Sentence 171: Mr. Anderson is going to stay Secretary of Agriculture.
Sentence 172: That is definite.
Sentence 173: Just so long as they want to stay.
Sentence 174: Q. Mr. President, if Mr. Douglas came into your Cabinet, that might give Mr. Schwellenbach an opportunity to go somewhere else he would like to go, though, wouldn't it, sir?
Sentence 175: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 176: Well, let's discuss that when that happens, if it does.
Sentence 177: [16.]
Sentence 178: Q. Mr. President, in your budget there is estimated $27 billion Internal Revenue, and $4 billion in Miscellaneous Receipts.
Sentence 179: Now I was wondering, how are you going to figure on the returns from surplus property?
Sentence 180: It looks like that is a very small return next year for all this surplus property to be disposed of.
Sentence 181: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: Well, we will have to take the returns from surplus property for whatever it brings.
Sentence 183: We made the best estimate we were capable of making on that.
Sentence 184: Q. Apparently only bring about a billion and a half to two billion dollars.
Sentence 185: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 186: Well, your guess is as good as anybody's.
Sentence 187: From all the information we could get, we thought that was a very good guess.
Sentence 188: Q. Supposed to have about eighty to a hundred billion dollars worth of surplus property?
Sentence 189: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 190: Well, let's wait and see what it brings, and I will answer your question.
