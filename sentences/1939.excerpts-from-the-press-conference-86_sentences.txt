Sentence 49: Whether I will appoint three more, I do not know.
Sentence 50: In other words, there is no reason why I should not tell you the exact situation.
Sentence 51: My general thought is that I will appoint two more, and keep the sixth place vacant as a place to put in somebody to perform some special duty, some specific duty of a temporary character.
Sentence 52: That was the general thought originally, and it seems to be a pretty good one.
Sentence 53: Q. Would that, then, be temporarily filled from time to time, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: If necessary.

Sentence 59: When will those two be appointed?
Sentence 60: THE PRESIDENT: I do not know.
Sentence 61: Q. Mr. President, there seems to be some conflict between the Army Engineers having charge of flood control projects and the engineers of the Bureau of Reclamation, regarding the construction of some dams and reservoirs in the West.
Sentence 62: I believe you recently had some people here to talk over that situation.
Sentence 63: Is there anything you can tell us about it?
Sentence 64: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 65: Yes.
Sentence 66: It goes back, really, to the first study of the reorganization steps two years ago.
Sentence 67: At that time we had two agencies that were building the larger type of dams.
Sentence 68: One was the Bureau of Reclamation that has built Boulder Dam and was building Grand Coulee; and the other was the Army Engineers that were building Fort Peck and Bonneville.
Sentence 69: The feeling at that time was that these two construction agencies ought to be maintained for construction work in such a way that neither one of them would overwhelm the other, that there would be what might be called a healthy rivalry between the two big Government construction agencies instead of having the whole thing done by one.
Sentence 70: Both are extremely good.
Sentence 71: In the past few years the Army Engineers have, of course, got away beyond the Army personnel in their construction work.
Sentence 72: It was thought, for that reason, that the Army Engineers should not become too big.
Sentence 73: They only have a limited number of officers that can do the work; and it has got to the point where something like three-quarters of the Army Engineers' construction work was being done by civilian employees.
Sentence 74: The reason for keeping them from absorbing all the work is that their primary function is a military function.
Sentence 75: In case of war the Army Engineers are intended, the great bulk of them, for service at the front with the Army and, therefore, we felt it would be a mistake to make them so big that they would do all the construction work.
Sentence 76: So we laid down what might be called a rule of thumb; and that was that they would continue to do all the harbor work, all the Mississippi work and all the river work where flood control was the primary function—flood control and navigation, the two being tied together; and to allocate the rest of the work, that is to say, on the upper reaches of a river, especially where navigation did not enter into it, in such a way that the Bureau of Reclamation would be kept going with equal importance to the Army Engineers—to keep both organizations functioning.
Sentence 77: Each one would be merely a check on the other.
Sentence 78: The result is that we have now a very excellent system worked out so that when a report is asked from either Reclamation or the Army Engineers, it is studied by the other service.
Sentence 79: If there is a question of a dam on the upper reaches of the river that has irrigation possibilities, we weigh the importance of the irrigation as compared to navigation and flood control; and in some cases, of course, power enters into it to a certain extent.
Sentence 80: The system as worked out now will mean no crossing of wires, but it will mean that if a dam is principally for irrigation it would be done normally by the Reclamation people; and if it is primarily for navigation, it would be done by the Army Engineers. . . .
