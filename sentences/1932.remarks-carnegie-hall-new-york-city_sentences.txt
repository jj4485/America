Sentence 1: 1932 Remarks Carnegie Hall New York City

I HAVE ALWAYS failed at finding words to express what is in my heart at receptions such as you have given me.
Sentence 2: I am grateful for your generosity and your encouragement in this battle.
Sentence 3: It is a precious thing.
Sentence 4: It is evidence not only of the effort that you are making but it is evidence of what you will attain on the 8th day of November.
Sentence 5: This is not a time for a further discussion of public questions.
Sentence 6: You have heard enough of that from me for one night.
Sentence 7: I want to emphasize to you that this is not a question of a choice between men.
Sentence 8: It is not a question of choice between political parties.
Sentence 9: It is a question of choice between philosophies and destinies of your Government.
Sentence 10: An election is not confined to the election of a president.
Sentence 11: It means that if the policies in which you have faith are to be executed you must be represented in that sane philosophy by the government of your State.
Sentence 12: It would be helpful, but I should not take your time on the subject of my friend Bill Donovan.
Sentence 13: And I would remind you if we are to succeed in administration we must have staunch supporters in the House of Representatives.
Sentence 14: There has been no more staunch person than Mrs. Pratt, and there has been none more encouraging and more alive to the enemy.
Sentence 15: But the major purpose of my coming here is not that you might perhaps see me but that I might get some of your spirit.
Sentence 16: I wish to thank you and to express to you the gratitude that is in my heart for the reception which you have given me tonight.
