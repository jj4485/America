Sentence 1: 1938 Press Conference 16

Q. Good morning, Mr. President.
Sentence 2: THE PRESIDENT: How's the class?
Sentence 3: [referring to charts on the desk in front of him, which are to be explained to the correspondents and some of which are printed at the end of this press conference].
Sentence 4: Q. Back to school-going to school again.
Sentence 5: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 6: Yes, we are all accustomed to it.
Sentence 7: Q. Mac is going to explain it to us.
Sentence 8: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 9: Yes. (Laughter)
Sentence 10: The dotted line [referring to charts in front of him] represents the high cost of liquor.
Sentence 11: Q.
Sentence 12: Well, we are going up to where we can get it a little cheaper.
Sentence 13: The Nelson House bar is always—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 14: [interposing] Yes, they do not have the same overhead.
Sentence 15: Q. I don't think they will be able to get in today, it is a big crowd.
Sentence 16: THE PRESIDENT: Really?
Sentence 17: Q. Charge a buck a head
Sentence 18: and we would make some dough out of it.
Sentence 19: Q. Yes.
Sentence 20: THE PRESIDENT: I am requested by Mr. Wile
Sentence 21: [Frederic William Wile] to file a plea in avoidance.
Sentence 22: He sent me the following this morning and it calls for an answer on the part of Mr. Sullivan.
Sentence 23: Wile says:
I would make an observation
For your private information
Re a subject on which
You're somewhat in the dark.
Sentence 24: I am filled with high elation.
Sentence 25: When you tune in the wrong station
And mistake me
for a man who's made his Mark.
Sentence 26: Though he's no New Deal supporter,
On behalf of a reporter
I venture upon a prayer to embark.
Sentence 27: Sullivan's got the reputation
Which deserves perpetuation,
So I humbly rise to plead,
God save the Mark!"
Sentence 28: (Laughter)
Q.
Sentence 29: [Mr. Sullivan] That is about all I have to rely on.
Sentence 30: (Laughter)
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 31: Well, as you know, I talked with various agencies of the Government the past week in an effort to clarify for you certain economic problems and they worked up for me yesterday a statement on which they are all agreed.
Sentence 32: That is pretty good, to get six or eight different agencies of the Government to agree.
Sentence 33: It might be called noteworthy.
Sentence 34: So, I think the best thing I can do is to read what they have all agreed on.
Sentence 35: It is not very long and Mac
Sentence 36: [Mr. McIntyre]—it is only three and a half pages—has mimeographed copies of this so you won't have to take it down.
Sentence 37: (The President then read to the correspondents the statement printed at the end of this press conference.)
Sentence 38: Well, that is what they all agreed on.
Sentence 39: Then they had some charts, and I threw out all the charts I could not understand and I kept the ones I could understand and they are here behind me.
Sentence 40: This chart [indicating chart "Wholesale Prices and Employment"] shows that wide disparities between rigid and sensitive prices, between finished goods and raw materials, are closely related to low levels of employment shown on the lower curve, and that high levels of employment accompany balanced prices.
Sentence 41: The last two years are shown in more detail at the right of the chart.
Sentence 42: These [indicating] on the left are from 1929 through 1937.
Sentence 43: These will be taken out to the Press Room and you can look at them and memorize them.
Sentence 44: This chart [indicating chart headed "Per Capita Farm and Nonagricultural Income Available for Living and Living Costs, 1924-38"] shows incomes of farm and city workers compared with the living costs from 1924 through 1937.
Sentence 45: It shows first that living costs are relatively stable as compared with farm and city workers' incomes.
Sentence 46: The top dotted line is living costs.
Sentence 47: The dash line is per capita non-farm income, and the black line at the bottom is the per capita farm income.
Sentence 48: It shows also that a rise in prices and incomes can be achieved without a corresponding increase in the cost of living.
Sentence 49: You see, things were going along pretty well at that stage of employment through 1929, but here [indicating a point midway through 1929] this discrepancy between the dotted line and the black line is beginning to widen.
Sentence 50: This chart [indicating chart entitled "Wholesale Prices of Selected Agricultural Products, 1929-38"] shows index numbers of selected farm products from 1929 through 1937.
Sentence 51: Taking the 1929 prices as 100, this chart shows the movement of the four major farm commodities since that time.
Sentence 52: The first is cotton, 10 spot markets.
Sentence 53: The next one is wheat.
Sentence 54: The dotted line on the chart on the bottom shows hogs and the other, the black line, shows corn.
Sentence 55: As you know, corn and hogs go together.
Sentence 56: The 1929 prices, which are taken as a base, were themselves not very high in several cases, due to falling off in export demands, which had already begun to occur.
Sentence 57: Those averages were wheat 117, corn 93, hogs and cotton 18.25.
Sentence 58: The chart also shows that, even with Triple A operations, the prices of farm commodities continuously varied up and down and have not shown the rigidity shown by administratively determined prices.
Sentence 59: Here [indicating] there is a sharp fall.
Sentence 60: This chart [indicating chart entitled "Wholesale Prices of Selected Building Materials"] is, I think, one of the most significant ones.
Sentence 61: It shows the price trends of certain building materials.
Sentence 62: The top dotted line is cement.
Sentence 63: It shows that it started at about 105 in 1929, went down to nearly 80, came back in 1934 to just where it was before and has continued on the same level of around 105.
Sentence 64: On the other hand, structural steel, starting at 100, went down to 80, and in 1934 came back to 98, and since then has gone to nearly 120.
Sentence 65: Then you come to two other building materials, wall board and house paint, that today are both below the 1929 level.
Sentence 66: They took a big drop, of course, in 1932, but they have come back and have leveled out pretty well and are running along lower than what they were in 1929.
Sentence 67: Now, the next line is plaster.
Sentence 68: In 1929 it was 90.
Sentence 69: It has gone up by a series of leaps and bounds until it is now nearly 180.
Sentence 70: Prepared strip shingles did somewhat the same thing.
Sentence 71: They started below 90, went down to 80, and went clear up to 150, and are now back to 120, which is still 30 points above what it was in 1929.
Sentence 72: Q.
Sentence 73: You said that was a significant chart.
Sentence 74: What is the particular significance?
Sentence 75: THE PRESIDENT: It is the breaking down of raw materials in one industry, building, and it shows that you cannot make one general rule.
Sentence 76: You see, plaster is way up, prepared shingles are way up, and wall board and paint are still a little down.
Sentence 77: Q.
Sentence 78: The point is in the divergence?
Sentence 79: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 80: Yes, and also the fact that, taking it by and large, there are some pretty important materials there that are way up above the 1929 level.
Sentence 81: Now, this is going to save time and then if you have any more questions it is all to the good.
Sentence 82: I worked out some questions i thought you might ask.
Sentence 83: This is not to preclude you from asking others.
Sentence 84: Somebody will say, with a mind full of generalities, "What is to be done?"
Sentence 85: The problem is being talked on a good many fronts.
Sentence 86: There are many elements in the recovery program that have already been directed toward a better balance of prices.
Sentence 87: For example, the new farm bill will help, and we hope also that the new housing program, when it gets under way, will help.
Sentence 88: Q. Will you give us a copy of that?
Sentence 89: THE PRESIDENT: On the question of what is to be done: The problem is being talked on a good many fronts.
Sentence 90: There are many elements in the recovery program which have already been directed toward a better balance of prices.
Sentence 91: That phrase, "better balance of prices," is the key to the whole thing.
Sentence 92: For example, the new farm bill will help, we hope the new housing program will help, and the expanding relief program will help.
Sentence 93: Somebody else with a mind full of generalities will ask the second question: "Does this mean inflation?"
Sentence 94: No, the policy is to help restore balance in the price structure.
Sentence 95: Somebody will say, "Are we going to have a further deflation of the dollar?"
Sentence 96: The answer is, "No."
Sentence 97: Then, along the same line, is the action that was taken on Monday in regard to the sterilization of gold.
Sentence 98: Is it a part of the plan to increase prices?
Sentence 99: Yes, that was one of the considerations for doing it, but not the only one; there were a lot of others.
Sentence 100: Then somebody will say, "How do you reconcile this with what you said last April, nearly a year ago?"
Sentence 101: I jotted down this note, "A question like that is a good deal like saying that a man who warns you to go slow on the curve is responsible if you run off the road.
Sentence 102: "
Q. Will you read that over again, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 103: It is like saying that a man who warns you to go slow on the curve is responsible if you run off the road.
Sentence 104: We all agree that price dislocations were one of the major causes of the recession.
Sentence 105: They included price maladjustments and speculative buying, which had been developing through the end of 1936 and the first four months in 1937, before I issued the warning that some prices were going too high.
Sentence 106: And the only question in my mind, from the point of view of hind sight, is, "Ought I not to have issued that warning before I did?"
Q.
Sentence 107: The warning in this case, Mr. President, was your observation in April?
Sentence 108: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 109: Yes.
Sentence 110: Then, more on finance is the credit policy of the Government: We expect to continue to maintain easy credit conditions.
Sentence 111: The Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board are both cooperating toward that end.
Sentence 112: We talked in the past a good deal about the 1926 price level.
Sentence 113: Are we aiming at the 1926 price level?
Sentence 114: Yes and no.
Sentence 115: In other words, it is not a question of restoring the level definitely to a given year.
Sentence 116: We are seeking to balance the relationship among different groups of prices that will pro. mote full employment.
Sentence 117: Q. Will you repeat that?
Sentence 118: THE PRESIDENT: We are seeking to balance the relationship among different groups of prices that will promote full employment.
Sentence 119: In other words, suppose I put it this way: Away back in 1933, as you remember, we did a lot of talking in 1933 and 1934 about bringing the price level up from around 68 or 69 to somewhere around 90 or 100.
Sentence 120: We took 1926 as a criterion.
Sentence 121: Why?
Sentence 122: Because that year represented what might be called the average of the loaned dollar; it was the average of the dollar which was owed by people.
Sentence 123: Now, since 1933 or 1934, there has been a great deal of new loaning and new borrowing in terms of the dollar of 1935, 1936 and 1937.
Sentence 124: That has to be taken into consideration as a modifying factor on the 1926 dollar.
Sentence 125: Do you understand that?
Sentence 126: Q. Which way does the modification go, up or down?
Sentence 127: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 128: Down, in that case.
Sentence 129: In other words, I cannot say that we are going to try to get the price level back to 90 or 95, as compared with 1926.
Sentence 130: It is a varying thing by which you take, originally, a norm, a figure.
Sentence 131: Now, subsequent happenings have some relationship on that original figure you take and the effect in the last few years has been downward from that figure of 100.
Sentence 132: Q.
Sentence 133: What is the difference between the 1926 price and the 1935 price level?
Sentence 134: That is, how much spread is there between the two?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 135: Well, if 1926 was 100—I do not know, I would have to ask Henry Morgenthau.
Sentence 136: MR. EARLY: We can give them that afterwards.
Sentence 137: THE PRESIDENT: Don't use this: We got it up somewhere between 90 and 92 in the beginning of 1936 and 1937.
Sentence 138: Q.
Sentence 139: Then the price to be aimed at would be somewhere between 92 and 100?
Sentence 140: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 141: But what you write today would not be followed six months from now.
Sentence 142: Q.
Sentence 143: It is somewhere below 1926, but somewhat above what it is today?
Sentence 144: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 145: Yes.
Q.
Sentence 146: It is easy to see how the new farm bill would bring about the balance in agricultural prices, but not so easy to see how the relief program and housing program would bring about a balance in the industrial prices.
Sentence 147: Can you explain that further?
Sentence 148: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 149: Well, of course on both housing and relief it tends to increase production and it is very largely in industries that there is need to increase production.
Sentence 150: Q. Mr. President, do you contemplate using relief for any new activity other than it has been used for?
Sentence 151: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Q.
Sentence 152: In the case of the housing program, do you not think, sir, that the wage levels are also a factor?
Sentence 153: THE PRESIDENT: That is the very next question.
Sentence 154: You are a mind reader.
Sentence 155: Are labor costs too high?
Sentence 156: The real answer to lower costs of production is to be found in increased volume rather than lower wages.
Sentence 157: That is in spite of the fact that earnings per hour in manufacturing were 24 per cent higher in 1936 than in 1932.
Sentence 158: Q.
Sentence 159: The only one who can get it is Kannee
Sentence 160: [Henry Kannee, stenographer at press conferences].
Sentence 161: (Laughter)
Sentence 162: Q. Would you mind repeating it?
Sentence 163: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 164: The real answer to lower costs of production is to be found in increased volume rather than in lower wages.
Sentence 165: Now, here is the illustration: Despite the fact that earnings per hour in the manufacturing groups were 24 per cent higher in 1936 than in 1932, the labor costs per unit of output were only 6 per cent higher.
Sentence 166: This was due in part to the fact that the productivity of labor increased.
Sentence 167: To put that in plain English, the efficiency of labor increased, but it was primarily due to the fact that labor can be used more efficiently in mass production industries when those mass production industries operate at the high level of output.
Sentence 168: It is further demonstrated by what happened in the last five months.
Sentence 169: Despite the fact that wages have not increased in the last five months, the shrinking volume of output has forced up labor costs per unit of production as much as they had risen in the previous four years.
Sentence 170: Q.
Sentence 171: The shrinking output at what time?
Sentence 172: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 173: In 1932 to 1937.
Sentence 174: The shrinking output forced up the labor costs per unit of output as much as they had risen in the last four years. . .
Sentence 175: .
Sentence 176: Then, further on wages because I have not completely covered that yet, did the wages rise too fast last spring, that is, in the spring of 1937?
Sentence 177: There were very few wage increases between 1934 and October, 1936, very few; but in the following nine months—that is to say, from October, 1936, through to July, 1937-hourly earnings in manufacturing plants rose from 57 cents to 65 cents.
Sentence 178: In other words, it was a sudden rise.
Sentence 179: There had been very little rise in the past few years.
Sentence 180: We know that many firms were in a position to increase wage rates in the two previous years, 1935 and 1936, and therefore it was probably not healthy for business to have postponed for so long their wage increases with the result of having to absorb wage increases in a large lump in those nine months from October, 1936, to the summer of 1937.
Sentence 181: Then, just by way of commenting further on that, I notice that during the downswings, recessions, people speak of the need of flexible wages and feel that wages should fall.
Sentence 182: Then, during recovery, as the figures prove, they seem to forget that wages should also be flexible and should rise.
Sentence 183: They delay wage increases until the last possible moment and then, at the peak of a boom, grant wage increases that are small when measured against current profits of industry.
Sentence 184: Q. Take that last sentence slower.
Sentence 185: THE PRESIDENT: They delay wage increases until the last possible moment and then, at the peak of a boom, grant wage increases that are small in comparison with their profits, but which, at the same time, are difficult to maintain when their volume falls off.
Sentence 186: The automobile industry is the prize example of that.
Sentence 187: Q. Mr. President, then, in the case of the automobile industry, do you say that if they increase production to full capacity and prices were reduced, there would be a material increase in sales?
Sentence 188: THE PRESIDENT: No, no.
Sentence 189: There is such a thing as increasing production to the point where the country cannot swallow it-gets indigestion.
Sentence 190: If the wage increases were not so long delayed but were made as business improved, managers of business would have a longer period of activity in which to adjust themselves to changes.
Sentence 191: It means, if the AP would give you a few small raises, twice a year, it would be better for the AP than if they gave you a 50 per cent raise all in one lump sum.
Sentence 192: Q.
Sentence 193: [Mr. Storm] I will take mine either way, Mr. President.
Sentence 194: (Laughter)
Q.
Sentence 195: On that subject, have you any thought of the sliding wage scale in connection with variations in prices?
Sentence 196: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Sentence 197: The next question I asked myself—
Q.
Sentence 198: [interposing] On that question, Mr. President, what do you think of a system of profit sharing in that connection?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 199: Well, of course that is being introduced in a good many industries, I think very successfully, taking it by and large.
Sentence 200: The next question is, "How about coal price fixing?"
Sentence 201: Well, there you get your specific industry question.
Sentence 202: The prices of bituminous coal are not high; that is, the price at the mine.
Sentence 203: I am talking about the price at the mine, not the prices you have to pay in your own houses.
Sentence 204: Cutthroat competition at the mines has always dominated this particular industry and has made it impossible for the industry to pay decent wages and give a profit.
Sentence 205: Of course we all know that.
Sentence 206: The purpose of the Guffey Act is to help establish the bituminous coal industry on a sound basis.
Sentence 207: That means that prices must not be set so high as to transfer business from efficient coal mines to other types of fuel—competitive types of fuel- or to give monopoly profits to coal producers.
Sentence 208: Then Mark's [Mr. Sullivan's] little red hen asks about the new farm bill.
Sentence 209: The farm prices are glaring examples of prices that are now too low.
Sentence 210: The farm bill is intended to prevent extreme declines in farm prices and to maintain income of farmers in years of excessive yields caused by nature.
Sentence 211: At the same time, by carrying over excessive supplies from years of large crops to years of lean crops, the bill is intended to prevent such rapid rises in farm prices due to short crops as occurred in the winter of 1936-1937, and which added to speculation at that time.
Sentence 212: Of course we know that when a commodity starts going up it seems to be human nature that the faster it goes up the faster the speculative element enters the picture and tends to speed up the rise and drive it too high.
Sentence 213: The effect of this agricultural, industrial and monetary policy on foreign trade ought to be good in that foreign trade always improves when business activity improves.
Sentence 214: That is a fact that we seem to have discovered nowadays.
Sentence 215: Any measure that helps to bring about recovery in the United States also helps in world recovery and serves to increase both purchases from foreign countries—in other words, imports and sales to foreign countries—in other words, exports.
Sentence 216: Q. How about sugar prices?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 217: Somebody wanted to know about sugar prices.
Sentence 218: That, of course, is a different subject and falls into a different category, because the sugar act of 1937 established the sugar policy definitely and there is no reason to expect any change.
Sentence 219: Well, I think that is all I have got here.
Sentence 220: Q. Mr. President, how about the expanded relief program?
Sentence 221: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 222: Yes, that is $250,000,000.
Sentence 223: Q. Is that the expansion?
Sentence 224: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 225: Yes.
Sentence 226: Q.
Sentence 227: No more than that?
Sentence 228: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 229: No, we hope not.
Sentence 230: Q. Earlier in your statement you referred to the relation of of the debt burden to the general behaviour of prices.
Sentence 231: I wondered if you considered the war debt or foreign debt burden?
Sentence 232: THE PRESIDENT: No, exclusively the domestic debt.
Sentence 233: Q. Has the foreign debt question been considered in any other connection in the past twenty-four hours?
Sentence 234: THE PRESIDENT: No, not any more than in the last forty-eight days or the last four hundred and eighty days.
Sentence 235: Q.
Sentence 236: You said that the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve are going to adopt a policy designed to furnish freer credit.
Sentence 237: Can you be more specific on that?
Sentence 238: THE PRESIDENT: Not policies, measures.
Sentence 239: Q.
Sentence 240: What measures?
Sentence 241: THE PRESIDENT: Whatever measures are needed to carry out a policy.
Sentence 242: I did not say they were going to-
Sentence 243: wait a minute until I get this: We expect to continue to maintain easy credit conditions, and the policies of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board are definitely along that line.
Sentence 244: Q. Most of the things you said have related to stiffening up the fluid prices.
Sentence 245: Have you said anything about methods to give fluidity or flexibility to the rigid prices?
Sentence 246: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 247: Now you are asking about the industries that are more monopolistic.
Sentence 248: We hope so, but are not ready to "shoot on it."
Sentence 249: It is a big problem.
Sentence 250: Q. What about the excessive prices of the shipbuilders?
Sentence 251: It seems more or less to apply to both Merchant Marine and Naval.
Sentence 252: THE PRESIDENT: We are very much concerned.
Sentence 253: I have been talking to Joe Kennedy for the last two weeks, ever since the bids came in.
Sentence 254: They are far and away above the cost of building ships during the war period when the materials that entered into ships were a great deal lower-no, they were higher than they are today.
Sentence 255: Today they are lower, but the price of the ship has gone up and, frankly, the whole problem of shipbuilding in this country is a headache under present conditions.
Sentence 256: Q. On that point, again, Mr. Kennedy went before the Committee on the labor provisions of the Merchant Marine Act and, I think—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 257: [interposing] Not on that.
Sentence 258: I am going to talk to him about it in ten minutes, when he is sworn in.
Sentence 259: Q.
Sentence 260: He suggested, as an alternative, that they might build a few Merchant Marine ships in the Navy Yards.
Sentence 261: Is there any civil or legal inhibition against it?
Sentence 262: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 263: The chief problem is that the Government Navy Yards are about as full of construction work as they ought to be.
Sentence 264: Q.
Sentence 265: If you are going to have a continuing program, is it possible to have Navy Yards—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 266: [interposing] If the Government is going to build them, there are three ways: One is to finance a new yard, put in new equipment, new ways, supervise it, and have the work done under what might be called private management.
Sentence 267: If you remember, during the war we built a good deal and bought a good deal on the fixed fee basis.
Sentence 268: Q. "Cost plus"?
Sentence 269: THE PRESIDENT: No, not "cost plus" but "fixed fee," which is all the difference in the world.
Sentence 270: Another method would be to build our own yards and build them ourselves.
Sentence 271: The third would be to put new equipment and new ways in Navy yards and have the Navy build them.
Sentence 272: All of those are very, very slow methods of getting a Merchant Marine.
Sentence 273: Q. How about building them abroad?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 274: That is one of the suggestions made by Mr. Kennedy and the interesting thing is that almost every Congressman and Senator says: "That is the practical way of doing it, but I could not vote for it."
Sentence 275: (Laughter)
Q.
Sentence 276: How do you explain why they are able to build them cheaper in foreign ports?
Sentence 277: THE PRESIDENT: I don't know.
Sentence 278: I don't think anybody knows.
Sentence 279: Q. Was your remark on war debts meant to imply that the subject was mentioned?
Sentence 280: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 281: Oh, no.
Sentence 282: It was mentioned, but it is mentioned about once a week
Sentence 283: and we don't seem to be any further than we were two years ago.
Sentence 284: Q.
Sentence 285: There was a story published this morning that one of the Latin American countries has or is about to present a proposal for a military and naval alliance of all the Americas to guard against aggression by Europe or Asia?
Sentence 286: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 287: Yes, I read the story and I never heard of it until I read the story.
Sentence 288: You will have to ask the Secretary of State.
Sentence 289: Maybe he has heard something about it.
Sentence 290: I doubt it.
Sentence 291: Q. Would such alliance, if it came up, be contrary to our policy?
Sentence 292: THE PRESIDENT: That is a very "Jify" question.
Sentence 293: Statement and chart read and displayed to correspondents during foregoing Press Conference.
Sentence 294: THIS ADMINISTRATION has from the beginning pursued a policy designed to promote full employment of our human and material resources.
Sentence 295: That continues to be our policy.
Sentence 296: The productive power of our workers and our resources, if fully utilized, can provide and maintain a national income far above any levels we have yet reached.
Sentence 297: An important factor that determines whether we shall succeed or be blocked in our endeavor to attain full employment and a high level of income is the behavior of prices.
Sentence 298: In this connection careful attention must be given to: (1) the relations of the prices of various groups of commodities to each other; (2) the relations between commodity price levels and the levels of debt burdens and costs; (3) the direction and rate of movement of the general price level.
Sentence 299: To further its broad objective the Administration has, therefore, in its agricultural, industrial, and monetary programs necessarily been concerned both with the relation of the prices of groups of specific commodities to each other and with the movement of the general price level.
Sentence 300: The measures employed at any given time to further this policy must fit the needs of that time.
Sentence 301: A year ago there was ground for concern that a too rapid rise in the prices of some commodities was encouraging a speculative boom.
Sentence 302: During the past six months, on the other hand, the general price level and industrial activity have been declining.
Sentence 303: Government policy must be directed to reversing this deflationary trend.
Sentence 304: This does not mean that all prices should advance, nor that the rise should be rapid.
Sentence 305: Prices of different groups of products must be brought into balanced relation to one another.
Sentence 306: Some prices and some costs are still too high to promote that balanced relationship between prices that is necessary for sustained recovery.
Sentence 307: Continued high prices of many of the commodities not subject to highly competitive market forces intensify the downward pressure on all other prices.
Sentence 308: Those industries that have maintained prices and curtailed output should seek the restoration of profits through increased rather than through restricted output.
Sentence 309: The prices of some items are still at the highest levels reached in 1937; some are even higher than in 1929.
Sentence 310: When high prices sharply curtail sales there is real danger.
Sentence 311: This is shown by our recent experience with housing.
Sentence 312: A year ago there was a serious shortage.
Sentence 313: We had unused productive resources ample to overcome the shortage.
Sentence 314: Yet all the major elements in housing costs advanced so sharply by the spring of 1937 as to kill a promising expansion of activity in an industry whose restoration is vital to continued recovery.
Sentence 315: For industries, such as agriculture, that operate at a high level of capacity even when business activity is at low levels, the restoration of profits must come primarily through higher prices.
Sentence 316: Higher prices in such industries and increased output in other industries will, by increasing profits, encourage new investment in replacement and expansion of equipment.
Sentence 317: This is necessary to full recovery.
Sentence 318: The average family will benefit from the business recovery which a balanced price structure will foster.
Sentence 319: Increased employment and more continuous income should much more than offset any increase in the cost of living.
Sentence 320: Recently wholesale prices have declined markedly, yet that decline has been reflected in the cost of living only to a very slight degree.
Sentence 321: A moderate rise in wholesale prices at this time should only slightly affect living costs.
Sentence 322: Incomes of most families will increase while the cost of what the housewife buys should show little change.
Sentence 323: The average family will enjoy a higher standard of living.
Sentence 324: It is clear that in the present situation a moderate rise in the general price level is desirable, and that this rise need not and should not extend to all prices.
Sentence 325: The rise should take place in and must be mainly confined to classes of commodities whose prices are too low.
Sentence 326: These include most of those raw materials and finished products which are produced and sold under highly competitive conditions.
Sentence 327: Such rise must not be so sharp or continue so long as to lead to a repetition of the unhealthy speculative conditions of a year ago.
Sentence 328: That sharp rise in prices encouraged speculative inventory buying which, combined with the decline in housing construction, laid much of the ground for the present recession.
Sentence 329: We must do everything we can to prevent this from happening again.
Sentence 330: Our program seeks a balanced system of prices such as will promote a balanced expansion in production.
Sentence 331: Our goal is a constantly increasing national income through increasing production and employment.
Sentence 332: This is the way to increase the real income of consumers.
Sentence 333: This is not a policy of restriction; it is a policy of abundance.
Sentence 334: Our agricultural, industrial, housing and monetary programs have been and will be directed toward this end.
Sentence 335: (This statement was prepared at the President's request by Henry Morgenthau, Jr., secretary of the Treasury; Henry A. Wallace, Secretary of Agriculture; Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor; Marriner Eccles, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; and economists of various executive departments.)
