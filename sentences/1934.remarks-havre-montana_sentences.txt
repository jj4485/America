Sentence 1: 1934 Remarks Havre Montana

I wish I had a loud speaker on the train, but there is none.
Sentence 2: This is not a political campaign.
Sentence 3: I have never been through this section of Northern Montana and the reason I chose this particular route was because I wanted to learn something at first hand both by talking to the people, and seeing conditions with my own eyes.
Sentence 4: As you know, we are trying to do a good many new things, but I believe the country understands what we are trying to do and is supporting our effort to make a better living for the average citizen.
Sentence 5: I notice that here we are on the outskirts, the edge, of what we call the secondary drought area.
Sentence 6: I am glad it has not been any worse here than it actually has.
Sentence 7: We have to provide in the days to come for the elimination of the causes not only of drought but of the conditions that come from drought.
Sentence 8: It is going to take a long time to do it, but, as I have said before, I think we are on our way and that you good people understand it and are supporting it.
Sentence 9: I wish I had time to stop off here and spend a little longer time, but I have been away from Washington now for a little over five weeks—it was actually five weeks yesterday—having covered the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Canal Zone and Hawaii.
Sentence 10: I have to get back to the Nation's capital.
Sentence 11: I hope when I come back through here next that things are going to be better than they are today.
Sentence 12: Many thanks.
