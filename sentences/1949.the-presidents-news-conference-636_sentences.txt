Sentence 1: 1949 The Presidents News Conference 636

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have no special announcements to make this morning, ladies and gentlemen, but I will try to answer questions.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: Q. Mr. President, Senator Vandenberg, in speaking about the Atlantic Pact in the Senate yesterday, expressed a desire that you lead a new crusade for world peace and, after the conclusion of the pact in the Senate, address a new message of peace to the world and reassure them of our peaceful intentions.
Sentence 5: Do you have any such thing under consideration?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 6: Well, since April 12, 1945, I have been making a crusade--a continuing crusade--for peace, and I don't think there ever has been an opportunity that I didn't use that subject as one to talk about.
Sentence 7: If you will study all the speeches and messages that I have written to Congress, and the speeches that I have made outside on the world situation, you will find that that is the keynote of every one of them.
Sentence 8: I am going to keep it up.
Sentence 9: Q.
Sentence 10: Then you may very well do it again, after the pact--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 11: I say I expect to keep it up just on the same line that I have spoken of it all the time ever since April 12, 1945.
Sentence 12: Q. Mr. President, I think what he had in mind was to emphasize the disarmament aspects of the Vandenberg resolution and the strengthening of the United Nations?
Sentence 13: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 14: The disarmament program is before the United Nations, and when the atomic energy part of that disarmament pact is agreed to by all the nations, then we can talk about disarmament, but not before.
Sentence 15: Q. Mr. President, the talk of your doing something about peace seems to imply a feeling that we aren't heading toward peace.
Sentence 16: Is it your thought that the world is moving toward peace?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 17: Oh yes, it is moving gradually--slowly and gradually toward world peace, and we will eventually get it.
Sentence 18: I have said that all the time.
Sentence 19: [2.]
Sentence 20: Q. Mr. President, have you any comment, sir, on the plan of Senators Humphrey, Murray, and Sparkman to create a $15 billion public works fund against unemployment and so on?

Sentence 23: [3.]
Sentence 24: Q. Mr. President, do you have any thought as to who should replace Senator Wagner?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: No, no.
Sentence 26: That is not my business.
Sentence 27: That is the business of the great State of New York.
Sentence 28: [4.]
Sentence 29: Q. Mr. President, some opponents of the Tydings bill to amend the National Security Act take the position that it would make the Secretary of Defense a potential dictator of the country.
Sentence 30: Do you care to express an opinion as to the validity of that?
Sentence 31: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 32: I think it is a perfectly absurd opinion.
Sentence 33: As long as the Constitution makes the President of the United States the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, I don't think anybody else can take him over very well.
Sentence 34: [5.]
Sentence 35: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us what plans the administration has to help Britain to overcome its present financial crisis?

Sentence 40: Can you tell us something about the administration's plans to help Britain overcome its present financial crisis?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 41: The matter is being discussed in Paris and London now.
Sentence 42: I can make no statement on it at the present time.
Sentence 43: Q. Will you deal with this at all in your Economic Message?
Sentence 44: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 45: No, I will not.
Sentence 46: That Economic Message is one on the United States of America.
Sentence 47: Q.
Sentence 48: Yes, I know, but I thought maybe this would be brought--
THE PRESIDENT, No.
Sentence 49: [6.]
Sentence 50: Q. Mr. President, there have been persistent rumors from abroad in the last couple of weeks, one from London, and one this morning from Rome, that you are going to visit Europe sometime in the next year?
Sentence 51: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: Well, I had no such plan.
Sentence 53: That is the first I had heard about it.
Sentence 54: A lot of people know more about what I am going to do than I do.
Sentence 55: Q.
Sentence 56: They even have you visiting the Vatican.
Sentence 57: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: As I said, I hadn't heard about it before, and I have no such intention.
Sentence 59: I have no such intentions.
Sentence 60: [7.]
Sentence 61: Q. Mr. President, you still take an interest in Missouri politics--are you going to take any interest in the 1950 campaign?
Sentence 62: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: I certainly am.
Sentence 64: Missouri is my home State, and I shall express my opinion freely in the Missouri campaign.
Sentence 65: Q. What about the primary?
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: I may not participate in the primary, but in the general election I will tell you what I think later.

Sentence 74: [9.]
Sentence 75: Q. Mr. President, has the administration any move in mind in connection with the Hawaii strike?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: None whatever.
Sentence 77: There is no move that we can make.
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, when the Taft-Hartley repeal bill was up, there was a lot of discussion that the President had some inherent powers to move in on these situations and stop strikes?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: He has.
Sentence 80: He has.
Sentence 81: He has inherent powers where the welfare of the Nation is at stake, or where there has been a breakdown of communications between the several States, or between the United States and foreign nations.
Sentence 82: But that condition doesn't exist in the Hawaii strike at all.
Sentence 83: Q. Wasn't it a national emergency when the Japs dropped some bombs on Pearl Harbor?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: That was a difficulty between a foreign nation and the United States, and we met it.
Sentence 85: [10.]
Sentence 86: Q. Mr. President, has Ward Canaday decided whether he will accept the chairmanship--
THE PRESIDENT.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: Chairman of the Munitions Board.
Sentence 92: Q.
Sentence 93: They don't call it the Army and Navy Munitions Board?

Sentence 103: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: Well, I don't know whether I want any such powers or not.
Sentence 105: [12.]
Sentence 106: Q. Mr. President, last week you said you were going to continue to fight for Taft-Hartley repeal.
Sentence 107: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: That's right.
Sentence 109: I shall.
Sentence 110: Q. On that line, I wonder whether you have asked your leaders in the House to bring the bill up again in the House at this session?
Sentence 111: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 112: They are considering it.
Sentence 113: We discussed the matter at the meeting Monday, to study the advisability of bringing it up again.
Sentence 114: Q.
Sentence 115: No decision as yet?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 116: They will make the decision.
Sentence 117: Q.

Sentence 131: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 132: Who said that?
Sentence 133: Q. John McCormack.
Sentence 134: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 135: Well, I think John probably would know what the situation is, for the simple reason that tax bills have to originate in the House of Representatives.
Sentence 136: [14.]
Sentence 137: Q. Mr. President, would you accept a Senate-House conference compromise on Taft-Hartley repeal?

Sentence 147: Every Congressman is interested in patronage.

Sentence 158: I will be gone exactly one day.
Sentence 159: My mind hasn't changed a bit on that subject, but that has been one matter which has been under consideration for a year or two, and I finally made up my mind that I would make the trip out there for the benefit of some of my friends who are generally interested in my being present.
Sentence 160: It is not a political trip, however.
