Q.
Sentence 21: On that ambassadorial subject, Mr. President, I understand quite a number of prominent persons have spoken to you and written you about Mr. Earl Brennan, with a background of 8 years in Italy for the State Department, and former head of an OSS section.
Sentence 22: Are you considering him for the Rome post?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 23: No.

Sentence 42: Q. Does that group include any of those, Mr. President, that have been lobbying?

Sentence 46: [5.]
Sentence 47: Q. Mr. President, has Mr. Hannegan contacted you lately, in regard to this caucus tonight?
Sentence 48: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 49: No, he has not.
Sentence 50: I saw, though, where the Republicans had been invited to that--[laughter]--which is a good thing.

Sentence 58: [7.]
Sentence 59: Q. Mr. President, what is your reaction to the proposal that Americans voluntarily, one day a week, go on a diet similar in caloric content to these European countries-
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 60: I think it would be a wonderful thing for them to do that--for 2 days a week.
Sentence 61: Q. 2 days?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 62: They would know, then, exactly what it means to go hungry.
Sentence 63: Most of us are eating too much.

Sentence 86: I think Mr. Lehman is very much mistaken.
Sentence 87: Of course, Mr. Lehman's heart is in this thing, and I am glad it is, because we have got to make every effort possible to feed these people.
Sentence 88: But if Mr. Lehman made the statement that the administration is not doing everything it can to meet the situation, he is mistaken in that.

Sentence 97: No, I didn't see that.
Sentence 98: I didn't know that they were.
Sentence 99: I don't believe in lobbying by the departments.
Sentence 100: I believe that these men should go down and express their views to the committee, and let the committee make up its mind on the facts.
Sentence 101: That was my policy when I was running a committee in the Senate.
Sentence 102: [13.]
Sentence 103: Q. Mr. President, do you intend to fill that vacancy on the Federal Communications Commission--

Sentence 114: Whatever a lobbyist usually does, that is what they were doing.
Sentence 115: They were giving out interviews all over the world.
Sentence 116: I saw one go out from Hawaii by an admiral in charge over there, and I don't think he knew what he was talking about.
Sentence 117: And that is really what stirred me up.

Sentence 119: What admiral was that, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: Melboe, wasn't it?

Sentence 136: I understand they are going to be moved to Germany.
Sentence 137: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 138: I hadn't heard it.
Sentence 139: I don't know about it.
Sentence 140: The best way--best thing is to ask the Secretary of War, I can't tell you.
Sentence 141: [16.]
Sentence 142: Q. Mr. President, can you say how quickly Ambassador Allen will go to Iran, and whether he is taking any special instructions--
