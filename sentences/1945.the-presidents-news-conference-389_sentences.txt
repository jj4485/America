Sentence 2: The Presidents News Conference 389

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: The first thing, I am exceedingly happy over the Bretton Woods--345 to 18.
Sentence 5: And the nonpartisan character of the support of that legislation makes me believe that the Congress really is for a peace treaty.
Sentence 6: [2.]
Sentence 7: In connection with Justice Jackson's war crimes report, which was given to you this morning,

I have been reminded that next Sunday, the 10th, will be the third anniversary of the ruthless destruction of that Bohemian village of--I don't know how to say it--L-i-d-i--

Sentence 12: [3.]
Sentence 13: I want to say something to you about the transportation situation that we are facing now, on account of the redeployment situation.
Sentence 14: Colonel Johnson was in to see me yesterday, and told me very plainly that we were going to have to meet this transportation situation in 10 months.
Sentence 15: We have only a third smaller job to do than the one which has just been finished, and it took--that was over a period of 48 months.
Sentence 16: This will be over a period of 10 months; that is, to transfer all our armed forces across the United States and the deployment in the Pacific--redeployment in the Pacific.
Sentence 17: The first transportation job was considered a miracle, and this one ahead of us is even bigger.
Sentence 18: And I want to impress it on our citizens that their best contribution in this case will be to stay at home.
Sentence 19: I have written a letter to Colonel Johnson on the subject, and a statement will be available when you go out.
Sentence 20: But that is most important, that redeployment transportation situation.
Sentence 21: It is going to strain every facility we have, in order to get it done on time.
Sentence 22: [4.]
Sentence 23: Mr. H. A. Millis, Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, has resigned, and I have appointed Paul M. Herzog of New York to be his successor.

Sentence 25: May we have that again?
Sentence 26: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 27: H. A. Millis, Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, has resigned.
Sentence 28: He has been trying to quit for some time.
Sentence 29: I appointed Paul M. Herzog.

Sentence 31: And I think he will be.
Sentence 32: [5.]
Sentence 33: I want to announce the--Stuart Symington of St. Louis will be appointed to succeed Senator Gillette when Senator Gillette's expiration date expires July 15th; but I have asked Mr. Symington to come up and get familiar with the job by cooperating with Judge Vinson, and the other two members of the Board, and Senator Gillette, before he leaves.
Sentence 34: Q. Mr. President, may I ask a question there?
Sentence 35: Do you plan any change in the three-man board to a single administrator for the--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 36: That is a congressional matter that will have to be done by law.
Sentence 37: I can't change it.
Sentence 38: Q. Will Mr. Symington be Chairman of the Board?
Sentence 39: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 40: He will be Chairman when Senator Gillette's expiration time expires.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 45: W. Stuart Symington.
Sentence 46: Q. S-y, isn't it?
Sentence 47: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 48: S-y-m-i-n-g-t-o-n.
Sentence 49: And he spells that Stuart in the English King manner--S-t-u-a-r-t.
Sentence 50: [6.]
Sentence 51: Q. Mr. President, is this NLRB term for a new term, or the unexpired term?
Sentence 52: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: It's to fill out the unexpired term, and for a new term also.

Sentence 66: I want to announce the resignation of Brigadier General Frank T. Hines as Veterans Administrator, and of the other job he has, and the--General Omar Bradley will be appointed in his place.
Sentence 67: [Low whistles and exclamations]
And I want to remind you of--[laughter]--a statement that was made at the press conference here, on May 15th, in which I said the Veterans Administration will be modernized, and that should be done as soon as possible.
Sentence 68: But at that time I was not ready to do the job immediately, because I hadn't obtained the consent of the War Department for General Bradley to serve.
Sentence 69: Q. Mr. President, will General Bradley be retired before
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: He will not.
Sentence 71: He will still be a four star General while he is in charge of the Veterans Bureau.
Sentence 72: Q. Will he have the other job, too--Reemployment and Retraining?
Sentence 73: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: I don't think so.
Sentence 75: I think I am going to dispose of that in another way at a little later date.
Sentence 76: Q. Mr. President, when is General Hines' resignation effective?
Sentence 77: Immediately ?
Sentence 78: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: No. General Hines' resignation is effective at my pleasure, and that will be when General Bradley can wind up his duties in Europe and take over.
Sentence 80: That will probably take 30 to 60 days to be accomplished.
Sentence 81: I wrote General Hines a letter, and here is the way I wind it up.
Sentence 82: You will get copies of both these letters, my letter and his letter of resignation too.
Sentence 83: [Reading]: "I want you to know that I have always had, and shall continue to have, complete confidence in you, and in your handling of public matters.
Sentence 84: In fact, I shall ask you within the near future to take another post of public importance, and I hope you will accept it."

Sentence 86: Q. Mr. President, on that point, can you say anything about--now-about the construction of the medical divisions of the Veterans Bureau ?
Sentence 87: Any change contemplated there?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 88: I would rather not discuss it now, because I will discuss it at a later date.
Sentence 89: When General Bradley takes over here, I will give you the complete layout of it--what we propose to do.
Sentence 90: Q. Mr. President, you mean there will be a reorganization?
Sentence 91: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: It will be modernized, let's put it that way.
Sentence 93: It will be a Veterans Administration for World War II.
Sentence 94: That was the setup for World War I, and has been very adequately handled for World War I.
Sentence 95: But as a World War I soldier, I wouldn't have been happy to have had the Spanish-American War veterans running the Veterans Administration, and I don't think--[laughter]--the new veterans would.
Sentence 96: I think they would much rather have a general of their own war in the place.
Sentence 97: And General Hines thought so, too-after we discussed it.
Sentence 98: Are there any questions?
Sentence 99: [Laughter]
Sentence 100: [9.]
Sentence 101: Q. Mr. President, are you in complete agreement with Justice Jackson's report?
Sentence 102: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 103: I am in entire agreement with it.
Sentence 104: I think it's a good report, and I think it shows just exactly what we are attempting to accomplish.
Sentence 105: Q. Mr. President, can you shed any light on one section of that report, where Justice Jackson said that it was the inescapable responsibility of this Government to prosecute these war criminals, even if this Government had to do it alone?
Sentence 106: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: That's just--it means just exactly what it says.
Sentence 108: That is what we propose
Q.
Sentence 109: Is there any prospect that we will have to do it alone?
Sentence 110: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: No, no.
Sentence 112: That's just to make it emphatic.
Sentence 113: Q.
Sentence 114: Any prospect of an early answer from the other countries on our suggestion for a military tribunal?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 115: Yes, I think so.
Sentence 116: I don't think there will be any delay on that.
Sentence 117: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 118: The British have already come in, and I am sure the Russians and the French will.
Sentence 119: I beg your pardon?
Sentence 120: [10.]
Sentence 121: Q. Can you tell us whether you plan any early action to curb rises in real estate and security prices?
Sentence 122: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 123: I haven't gone into that.
Sentence 124: I have been discussing it with Judge Vinson, but have come to no conclusion on them.
Sentence 125: [11.]
Sentence 126: Q. Mr. President, have you any comment on the Federal Corporation Control bill, so called--Byrd-Butler bill?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 127: Well, as a Member of the Senate, I was always against that bill.
Sentence 128: [12.]
Sentence 129: Q. Mr. President, in connection with your statement about transportation, if the situation should become critical, would you be prepared to recommend Federal control, or rationing?
Sentence 130: In other words, controlling the traveling public?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: I hope that will not be necessary, but if it becomes necessary, I will certainly do it.
Sentence 132: [13.]
Sentence 133: Q. Mr. President, did you give your approval to the suit filed[inaudible
Sentence 134: words]--on those oil lands by Justice
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 135: I told the Department of Justice to file the suit.
Sentence 136: [14.]
Sentence 137: Q. Mr. President, would you care to comment--what is your feeling on the St. Lawrence Seaway?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 138: I will discuss that at a little later date.
Sentence 139: You will find the record on that in the Senate, also.
Sentence 140: [15.]
Sentence 141: Q. Mr. President, do you--would you favor a Big Five meeting to settle the Syrian dispute?
Sentence 142: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 143: I would not.
Sentence 144: Q. Mr. President, would you care to comment on the progress of Mr. Hopkins' talks in Moscow?
Sentence 145: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 146: I will discuss that when Mr. Hopkins returns--discuss it fully.
Sentence 147: I don't want to discuss it now.
Sentence 148: Q.
Sentence 149: Do you have any comment now on the position of the veto in San Francisco?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: That will be discussed from San Francisco very shortly.
Sentence 151: Q. Sir, have you received from Mr. Hopkins a message, saying that he made better than hoped for progress in Moscow ?
Sentence 152: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 153: I hope you won't force me to answer that, because I want to discuss that when Mr. Hopkins gets back.
Sentence 154: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, would you elaborate on that subject--that statement you made, about being discussed from San Francisco ?
Sentence 155: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 156: The announcement will be made from San Francisco.
Sentence 157: Q. Shortly?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 158: Yes, very shortly.
Sentence 159: Q. Mr. President, could you amplify your views on the Big Five meeting with Syria?
Sentence 160: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 161: Well, the meeting that was contemplated is a Big Three meeting to discuss world affairs.
Sentence 162: I think that the Near Eastern situation will be worked out without any Big Five meeting.
Sentence 163: Q.
Sentence 164: Any news on the Big Three meeting, when it may be?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 165: Well, I think it will be sometime within the next 40 days.
Sentence 166: That is as near as I can come to it.
Sentence 167: [16.]
Sentence 168: Q. Apparently, you have been taking up this matter of commercial aviation in the postwar period, in your series of talks in the past week.
Sentence 169: Is there anything you could tell us about the position we are in, with reference to that now, or--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 170: No, I can't.
Sentence 171: I am not in a position to make a statement on that, but I will be, I think, next week.
Sentence 172: [17.]
Sentence 173: Q. Mr. President, the labor leaders saw you today, and they told us they asked you to--for an upward revision of the Little Steel formula.
Sentence 174: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 175: They did.
Sentence 176: Q.
Sentence 177: What do you think of that?
Sentence 178: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 179: They always ask that, every time they come around.
Sentence 180: [Laughter]
Q. Do you think it should be revised upward ?
Sentence 181: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: I am not in any position to make a statement on that.
Sentence 183: We will work out a survey of the situation at a later date, and then come to a conclusion.
Sentence 184: At present, it stands.
Sentence 185: [18.]
Sentence 186: Q. Mr. President, did you discuss taxes with Senator George this morning?
Sentence 187: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 188: No, I did not.
Sentence 189: I did not.
Sentence 190: [19.]
Sentence 191: Q. Can you give us your views on this bill passed by the House, giving Congressmen $2500 for expense accounts, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 192: Well, my views are that the Members of the House and the Senate are grossly underpaid.
Sentence 193: I think they should have a salary commensurate with the work they do, and I have always thought that.
Sentence 194: And I can say it now, for I am no longer a Member of the Senate.
Sentence 195: [Laughter]
I think the Senators ought--and the Members of the House--ought to be in the position so that their principal employer would be the United States of America, and that they ought to pass an adequate salary bill for themselves.
Sentence 196: I would certainly sign it if they did, because I know that they need it.
Sentence 197: I don't think the Senate or House should be a rich man's club.
Sentence 198: I think the common, ordinary citizen ought to have a chance to serve.
Sentence 199: Q.
Sentence 200: Do you think it is, at the moment?
Sentence 201: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 202: Not now.
Sentence 203: It has been.
Sentence 204: Q. Does that mean, Mr. President, that you don't think this is the method to do it with?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 205: No, I don't.
Sentence 206: I think they ought to come straight out and raise their salaries and be done with it.
Sentence 207: Q. Would you veto the bill then, sir?
Sentence 208: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 209: No, I won't veto it.
Sentence 210: This is a legislative job and I will--if they want it that way, let them have it, because I know they need the money; but I say it would be much better for them if they would come out for a straight salary raise.
Sentence 211: Q. Have you a suggestion for an adequate salary?
Sentence 212: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 213: Anywhere from $15,000 to $25,000 a year.
Q. Mr. President, you didn't mean to suggest that their principal employers weren't the United States?
Sentence 214: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 215: No, I did not, but I know in my own case, in order to meet my bills, I had to make my wife my secretary.
Sentence 216: She had to work all the time in the public interest, instead of keeping house.
Sentence 217: I didn't like it!
Sentence 218: [Laughter]
Sentence 219: And you made a campaign issue out of it in the last campaign, and the people liked it.
Sentence 220: But that shouldn't happen, there is no sense in that at all.
Sentence 221: This Government is rich enough to pay its employees an adequate salary, and they ought to do it.
Sentence 222: Q. Mr. President, do you think diplomats' salaries should be increased?
Sentence 223: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 224: I do that.
Sentence 225: I think it is absolutely necessary.
Sentence 226: [20.]
Sentence 227: Mr. President, can you comment on the visit of Justice Black with you this morning?
Sentence 228: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 229: It was a social call.
Sentence 230: Justice Black and I have been friends ever since I went to the Senate.
Sentence 231: This is the first chance--
Q.
Sentence 232: [Interposing loudly]
Sentence 233: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 234: THE PRESIDENT.--time he has had a chance to call on me.
Sentence 235: [Laughter]
