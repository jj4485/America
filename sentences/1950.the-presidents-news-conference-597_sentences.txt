Sentence 148: Our position hasn't changed a bit.
Sentence 149: It has been just exactly that all along.
Sentence 150: We have been reiterating it.
Sentence 151: I have said it over and over and over, I think a hundred times, right here in this conference, and there isn't any use getting all steamed up on the subject, because we are continuing all the time every effort we possibly can to create a peaceful situation in the world.
Sentence 152: And if we could get just one little bit of cooperation from the Soviet Government, we could get the job done.
Sentence 153: [17.]

Sentence 159: No.
Sentence 160: I am having the water commission
7
make a complete survey of the water situation in the United States.
Sentence 161: You know, New York is just as much interested in the subject as California is, and so is Baltimore, and so is Houston, Tex., and a half dozen other cities that I could name to you.
Sentence 162: That is the reason I appointed this water commission.
Sentence 163: 7 See Item I.
Sentence 164: The water situation in the Southwest is in a terrible situation.
Sentence 165: Arizona and California are both drying up.
Sentence 166: We have got to find some sort of a manner in which to meet that situation.
Sentence 167: And that is the reason I have appointed that water commission to make a survey.
Sentence 168: I hope we can solve it, but it is a very delicate and a very important problem.

Sentence 170: [18.]

Sentence 175: 8
Q.

8 Bernard M. Baruch, the United States Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, set forth the position of the United States in his address delivered at the opening session of the Commission in New York City on June 1946.
Sentence 177: In his address Mr. Baruch stated that "The United States proposes the creation of an International Atomic Development Authority, to which should be entrusted all phases of the development and use of atomic energy, starting with the raw materials and including: (I) managerial control or ownership of all atomic-energy activities potentially dangerous to world security, (a) power to control, inspect, and license all other atomic activities, (3) the duty of fostering the beneficial uses of atomic energy, (4) research and development responsibilities of.
Sentence 178: an affirmative character intended to put the Authority in the forefront of atomic knowledge and thus to enable it to comprehend, and therefore to detect, misuse of atomic energy.
Sentence 179: To be effective, the Authority must itself be the world's leader in the field of atomic knowledge and development and thus supplement its legal authority with the great power inherent in possession of leadership in knowledge.
Sentence 180: "
For the full text of Mr. Baruch's address see the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 14, p. 1057).
Sentence 181: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: No reason to reconsider it.
Sentence 183: It is just as good today as it ever was.
Sentence 184: Q. Not altered by anything now?
Sentence 185: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 186: Not the slightest.
Sentence 187: Not the slightest.
Sentence 188: In fact, it ought to be more useful now than it was then.
Sentence 189: We thought we were giving away, then, something good.
Sentence 190: We were on an even keel then, apparently.
Sentence 191: Q. Is it your idea, sir, that that ought to make Russia more receptive?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 192: I can't answer what Russia feels.
Sentence 193: I know how they have acted.
Sentence 194: I can only go on their actions.
Sentence 195: I can't tell you how Russia feels.
Sentence 196: Nobody knows.
Sentence 197: Except by their acts in the United Nations--and they have voted "no" every time.
Sentence 198: I don't think we have ever exercised the veto power.
Sentence 199: Q. Mr. President, does the Secretary's statement, then, foreclose any changes in the future on our atomic policy?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 200: There is no reason for any change.
Sentence 201: We are attempting to get international control of atomic energy and trying our best to get a peace in the world that will be good for everybody.
Sentence 202: That's all we are after.
Sentence 203: That's all we have ever wanted.
Sentence 204: That is the fundamental basis of our foreign policy.
Sentence 205: Q. Well, how about general disarmament?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 206: It is in the same category.
Sentence 207: Q.
Sentence 208: Can they be considered together, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 209: No, they cannot.
Sentence 210: Q. Are you intending to say that you think public discussion does no good?
Sentence 211: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 212: No, I am not.
Sentence 213: You needn't put words of that kind into my mouth.
Sentence 214: I will answer your questions--
Q.
Sentence 215: I thought I was asking one--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 216: All right, proceed.
Sentence 217: You don't put any words in my mouth.
Sentence 218: Q.
Sentence 219: Do you think that public discussion will answer the situation?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 220: Public discussion helps every situation.
Sentence 221: Q. Mr. President, I didn't quite get that.
Sentence 222: You said disarmaments are in the same category as what?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 223: As atomic control.
Sentence 224: They are.
Sentence 225: We are for both.
Sentence 226: Q. Mr. President, you said we are not ready to consider atomic disarmament or atomic agreement and general disarmament together?
Sentence 227: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 228: They go together.
Sentence 229: They are both in the same resolution in the United Nations, if you will read it.
Sentence 230: They do go together.
Sentence 231: Q.
Sentence 232: We are for atomic agreement first?
Sentence 233: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 234: I would like to have that atomic thing first, of course, but they are both in the same resolution in the United Nations.
Sentence 235: Q. Are we inflexible on that point, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 236: Doesn't mean inflexible.
Sentence 237: If we can get an atomic energy settlement, we won't have any trouble with the other.
Sentence 238: Q. Mr. President, do you think that the Fuchs case possibly aggravates the international situation with respect to atomic energy?
Sentence 239: 9
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 240: I have no comment on that.
Sentence 241: 9 Dr. Klaus Fuchs, German-born, naturalized British scientist convicted of having transmitted secret atomic information to the Soviet Union.
Sentence 242: Q. Couldn't hear that question.
Sentence 243: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 244: He wanted to know if this English scientist's case had any effect on that, and I said I can't comment on that.
Sentence 245: Reporter:
Sentence 246: Thank you, Mr. President
