Sentence 2: Please be seated, gentlemen.
Sentence 3: [1.]

Sentence 7: If you have any questions, I will make an endeavor to answer them.
Sentence 8: [2.]

Sentence 20: Q. Mr. President, the other night Harold Stassen who is, I think, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, and who I believe once aspired to the office you now hold, said that you were the cleverest politician and the worst President.
Sentence 21: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 22: That's quite a statement.
Sentence 23: I have no comment on it.
Sentence 24: Q.
Sentence 25: I just wondered if you shared those sentiments ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 26: Well, let's wait a little further until history is made, and then we will see.
Sentence 27: Q. Mr. President, if you are the cleverest politician ever in the White House, do you consider that smart politics to call the President "the worst President"?

Sentence 30: [5.]

Sentence 43: [6.]

3
a statement the other day that we are spending too much for armaments ?
Sentence 45: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 46: No, I have no comment on that.
Sentence 47: The budget speaks for itself.
Sentence 48: And the budget has been carefully made up by me on every occasion since I have been President.
Sentence 49: And it is a good budget, and it is as tight as it could be made.
Sentence 50: 3 Edwin G. Nourse, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Sentence 51: Q.
Sentence 52: He made the statement, you might recall, that every time Joe Stalin throws a scare into us, why we pour additional billions into armaments.

Sentence 55: [7.]
Sentence 56: Q. Mr. President, Senator Tydings said yesterday that it would he remarkable if the United States and Russia did not get into trouble ending in a shooting war.
Sentence 57: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: I think the Senator is unduly alarmed.
Sentence 59: I think he is unduly alarmed.
Sentence 60: I think the situation now is not nearly so bad as it was in the first half of 1946.
Sentence 61: I think it is improving.
Sentence 62: Maybe I am an optimist, but I have to be, to be President of the United States.
Sentence 63: Q.
Sentence 64: I didn't get the question, Mr. President.
Sentence 65: I got your
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: My comment on the statement that Senator Tydings made yesterday, that we were close to a shooting war with Russia.
Sentence 67: [8.]
Sentence 68: Q. Mr. President, Trygve Lie, before he left for Europe the other day, announced that he is now going to Moscow trying to interest Russia's leaders--Stalin, if possible--in a meeting of the heads of states with the Security Council.
Sentence 69: I wonder if you would care to comment on that, in particular as to whether that question was brought up with you?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: Mr. Lie came to see me to pay me a courtesy call, the second call he has made at my office since he has been the Secretary General of the United Nations.
Sentence 71: He made the statement to me then, at that meeting, that he expected to call on the heads of states and discuss world affairs with all of them.
Sentence 72: I did not go into detail with him on what he intended to discuss with anybody, and we only discussed the welfare of the world and the hope for peace.
Sentence 73: Q. Do you agree with him to a meeting at a time in which we might propose, to bring the heads of states together with the Security Council ?
Sentence 74: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 75: I have no comment to make on that.

Sentence 79: [9.]
Sentence 80: Q. Mr. President, would you comment on the argument being heard more frequently in the Senate these days, that in view of the prospective size of the deficit we can no longer afford Marshall plan aid if present conditions--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: Isn't that an old argument?
Sentence 82: Hasn't that been the argument of the "anti's" ever since the Marshall plan was instituted?
Sentence 83: The reason for the deficit is because the Congress has not given the necessary taxes to carry on the Government of the United States.
Sentence 84: Since we are fighting the cold war, we have to use every means at our command to do it.
Sentence 85: The Marshall plan is one of the principal means in fighting that cold war.
Sentence 86: It will be cheaper than a shooting war would be, as I have said time and time again.
Sentence 87: [10.]
Sentence 88: Q. Mr. President, some observers trying to figure out some of the primary election results gave me the suggestion that Communists in Government are a factor.
Sentence 89: I wonder if you could tell us whether--in the White House mail and what you hear from around the country--you find a growing concern among the American people--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 90: I haven't noticed any particular growing concern.
Sentence 91: The people have always been uneasy about an organization that believes in the overthrow of the Government of the United States by violence.
Sentence 92: And I don't think there is any unusual trend in that direction.
Sentence 93: At least, I haven't heard about it.
Sentence 94: [11.]
Sentence 95: Q. Mr. President, you indicated that you did not think the Florida primary results constituted a repudiation of your program.
Sentence 96: Would you mind telling us why?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: I think that the Florida primary campaign was a Florida campaign, and certain issues entered into that which have no bearing whatever on the national picture.
Sentence 98: [12.]
Sentence 99: Q. Do you wish to give us any information regarding the present status of the possible credit arrangement affecting Argentina, which is being extensively
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: I have been informed by the various departments of the Government that the Finance Minister of the Argentine Republic is up here negotiating some loans, and things of that sort.
Sentence 101: They have--the situation has not been put up to me for a decision.
Sentence 102: I think I should look favorably on it, when it is put up to me.
Sentence 103: Q. Favorably?
Sentence 104: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 105: Yes.
Sentence 106: [13.]
Sentence 107: Q. Do you plan a greatly increased defense budget for next year; and is that, one, because you cut it too low this year or, two, because of the increasing international emergency?
Sentence 108: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 109: The defense budget next year will be smaller than it is this year, and we are continually cutting it by economies.
Sentence 110: And we are not alarmed in any sense of the word.
Sentence 111: We are simply maintaining a defense program that is adequate for the defense of this country.
Sentence 112: Q. Excuse me, sir, have you not already increased it this year?
Sentence 113: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 114: We have asked for some contract authorizations for the purchase of some planes.
Sentence 115: The other increase is some savings that have already been made.
Sentence 116: Read the statement of the Secretary of Defense before the committee down there and you will have the whole thing just as it is.
Sentence 117: [14.]
Sentence 118: Q. Mr. President, many of the people in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska feel that they have been written off as expendable in case of war.
Sentence 119: On your forthcoming trip, will you tour the defenses of the Pacific Northwest.
Sentence 120: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 121: I will not.
Sentence 122: I will not.
Sentence 123: Their fears are unfounded and unnecessary, I will say that right here.
Sentence 124: [15.]
Sentence 125: Q. Mr. President, would you care to make any comment on ex-President Hoover's proposition to revamp the United Nations by excluding Communist nations?
Sentence 126: 4
4 Speaking before the American Newspaper Publishers Association on April 27 President Hoover stated, "What the world needs today is a definite concrete mobilization of the nations who believe in God against this tide of Red agnosticism.
Sentence 127: "It needs a moral mobilization against the hideous ideas of the police state and human slavery.
Sentence 128: The world needs mobilization against this creeping Red imperialism.
Sentence 129: The United States needs to know who are with us in the cold war against these practices, and who we can depend on.
Sentence 130: "Therefore, I have a proposal to make.
Sentence 131: "I suggest that the United Nations should be reorganized without the Communist nations in it.
Sentence 132: If that is impractical, then a definite new united front should be organized of those peoples who disavow communism, who stand for morals and religion, and who love freedom.
Sentence 133: "
The full text of President Hoover's address is published in the Congressional Record (vol. 96, p. A3148)
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 134: Yes.
Sentence 135: President Hoover called on me, at my suggestion, to discuss the reorganization plans that are now before the Senate and the House.
Sentence 136: And incidentally his speech of a night or two ago was brought up.
Sentence 137: Mr. Hoover and I are not in agreement on the United Nations program.
Sentence 138: I am in full support of the United Nations, both as an individual and as President of the United States.
Sentence 139: The United Nations is organized for the purpose of discussion of problems with which nations are faced, in the hope of arriving at a peaceful settlement of these problems.
Sentence 140: It is working, in most instances.
Sentence 141: We shall continue to support the United Nations as long as I am President of the United States.
Sentence 142: I discussed the other section of President Hoover's speech, which was the mobilization of the moral forces of the world against the unmoral forces of the world.
Sentence 143: I have been trying to do that for 5 years, and we are having some success in that.
Sentence 144: And I complimented him on that part of his speech.
Sentence 145: I did not agree with him on his proposed reorganization of the United Nations, and we are perfectly friendly, Mr. Hoover and I are.
Sentence 146: [16.]
Sentence 147: Q. Mr. President, has Senator Taylor of Idaho
5
been invited to accompany you through Idaho on your May trip?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 148: He has not.
Sentence 149: Senator Taylor has been, of course--he is a United States Senator from Idaho.
Sentence 150: When we go through Idaho, I will be glad to see the Senator from Idaho and shake hands with him, as I will with every other public official.

Sentence 155: Will they be invited this time?
Sentence 156: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 157: I will see any of them that want to see me, but I am not inviting people to ride on the train out in the States where there are primary fights.
Sentence 158: I try to be as neutral and fair about it as possible--be as polite to the public officials as I can.
Sentence 159: [18.]
Sentence 160: Q. Mr. President, will you give us your reaction to McCarthy's description of General Marshall as incompetent?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 161: I have no comment to make on anything McCarthy may say.
Sentence 162: It isn't worth commenting.
Sentence 163: [19.]
Sentence 164: Q. Mr. Guy George Gabrielson
6
has announced quite firmly that he is out to capture two Southern States if possible between now and 1952--Virginia especially, and Tennessee--by some coalition of the Dixiecrats and the Republicans.
Sentence 165: Would you consider the possibility, sir, of coming yourself to Richmond, or to Tennessee, and giving aid and comfort for the administration?
Sentence 166: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: Of course, I would be very glad to come to Richmond or Nashville, Tenn., at any time, under the proper auspices.
Sentence 168: And I think Gabrielson is rather optimistic in his prognostication.

Sentence 184: I think that it should be done.
Sentence 185: Q. Is it not too late by the time an emergency arises for the registration?
