Sentence 1: 1946 The Presidents News Conference 440

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: The fact-finding board on the threatened railroad strike was appointed this morning: Judge Leif Erickson of the Montana Supreme Court; Frank M. Swacker, lawyer at 120 Broadway, New York City; and Gordon S. Watkins, Department of Economics, University of California.
Sentence 4: That is a pretty even geographical distribution.
Sentence 5: [2.]
Sentence 6: I want to make a comment on two strike settlements, which I think deserve comment; that is, the rubber and the telephone strike settlements, settled strictly on a collective bargaining basis, and satisfactorily settled for both sides, without any ballyhoo or unnecessary conversation.
Sentence 7: There have been hundreds of such settlements which have received no notice.
Sentence 8: Those settlements were made by CIO unions, and A.F. of L. unions, and independent unions.
Sentence 9: And it is too bad that the people who do the right thing can't get just as much publicity as those who are always running for headlines to settle things in the newspapers.
Sentence 10: Q. Mr. President, in that connection, do you have any comment on the General Motors situation?
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 12: I have no comment.
Sentence 13: They had the same right to collective bargaining that the rest of these people have had.
Sentence 14: Q. Have you any comment on the fact-finding board's decision ?
Sentence 15: Do you still think it could be settled on that basis?
Sentence 16: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 17: That has always been my opinion.
Sentence 18: Q.
Sentence 19: In that connection, Mr. President, I believe the Detroit City Council yesterday asked if you would intervene.
Sentence 20: Is there any answer to that yet?
Sentence 21: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 22: I will not intervene.
Sentence 23: That is the answer.
Sentence 24: Q. Mr. President, in connection with the steel settlement, is it true that the fabricating end of the industry tends to follow the pattern of basic steel?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: Well, I thought maybe you might ask me that question, so I hunted up that question that I made at the time those gentlemen were in here, and I will just read it to you.
Sentence 26: This statement was issued by Mr. Ross: "The President said his recommendation for an 18 1/2-cent-an-hour wage increase applied only to the basic steel industry.
Sentence 27: The President stated he assumed other settlements would be made through negotiations, expressing the hope that the men on strike in those seven hundred companies would already be back at work as soon as possible."
Sentence 28: Now the union officials have claimed that I made certain commitments, and the men who do the hiring--management has claimed that I have made certain commitments; but that is the only commitment that was made.
Sentence 29: It was settled on basic steel, with the hope that negotiations would be followed through on the others.
Sentence 30: There have always been a number of fabricators who have followed the pattern of basic steel, and there is no reason why they shouldn't do it, but there are certain others who have negotiated their own wage program, even after basic steel was settled, and there is no reason why they shouldn't go ahead with their negotiations.
Sentence 31: [3.]
Sentence 32: Q. Mr. President, your presence on the stage at Fulton, Mo., has led to some speculation that you endorse the principles of Mr. Churchill's speech.
Sentence 33: Would you comment on that?
Sentence 34: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 35: I didn't know what would be in Mr. Churchill's speech.
Sentence 36: This is a country of free speech.
Sentence 37: Mr. Churchill had a perfect right to say what he pleased.
Sentence 38: I was there as his host in Missouri, because I had told him if he would come over here and give the lecture at that little college, that I would be glad to introduce him.
Sentence 39: Q.
Sentence 40: What is your opinion now of his speech, after you heard it, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 41: I have no comment.
Sentence 42: [4.]
Sentence 43: Q. Mr. President, Secretary Byrnes said in New York that to be a world power we had to have some form of universal military training.
Sentence 44: What steps have been taken by the administration to get a bill?
Sentence 45: It seems to be stalled in the House right now.
Sentence 46: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: The President has done everything he possibly can do in the matter.
Sentence 48: I don't know what else I can do.
Sentence 49: I can't tell the Senate and House what to do.
Sentence 50: Only in the form of a message, which message I have given to them.
Sentence 51: I went down there personally and read it to them.
Sentence 52: Q.
Sentence 53: That was in October, and nothing has been done.
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: Didn't think it was that late.
Sentence 56: I thought it was earlier than that.
Sentence 57: Q.
Sentence 58: Your message was in October.
Sentence 59: Q.
Sentence 60: Some time later, General Eisenhower, in talking to Members of Congress, thought it was a--indicated that he thought that universal training was impossible if the draft was continued; that is, you couldn't have the two things at the same time.
Sentence 61: What about the conflict between the two?
Sentence 62: You are still--still--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: I haven't discussed that matter with General Eisenhower.
Sentence 64: I don't know what his views are.
Sentence 65: If he made that statement to the Congress, that is evidently what he thinks, but I haven't discussed it with him.
Sentence 66: [5.]
Sentence 67: Q. Mr. President, are you familiar with how long the Combined Chiefs of Staff, representing the United States and Britain, intend to continue their planning for whatever they are planning?
Sentence 68: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 69: Until the war is officially ended.
Sentence 70: Q. Only until then, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 71: I can't answer that, cause we will have to settle that when the time comes.
Sentence 72: Q. Would you favor an Anglo-American military alliance after that?
Sentence 73: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: I will discuss that when the time comes.
Sentence 75: [6.]
Sentence 76: Q. Mr. President, referring to the labor situation, can you tell us anything about your conference with John Lewis and Mr. Hutcheson?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 77: I had a very pleasant conference with Mr. Lewis and Mr. Hutcheson.
Sentence 78: I have no comment to make on the conversations.
Sentence 79: That was between the President and those gentlemen.
Sentence 80: [7.]
Sentence 81: Q. Mr. President, can you clear up some confusion, whether "Cap" Krug is going to administer all the other jobs Ickes had, or redistribute some of them among other individuals?
Sentence 82: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 83: I will have to attend to that on the reorganization plan which is now in progress, under the new law.
Sentence 84: Krug will take over exactly where Mr. Ickes left off.
Sentence 85: Q. Is that temporary, applying to petroleum, coal, and everything else?
Sentence 86: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: He will have everything that was assigned to Mr. Ickes.
Sentence 88: [8.]
Sentence 89: Q. Mr. President, do you expect Mr. Pauley to withdraw his request for--
THE PRESIDENT. .
Sentence 90: I have made four statements on Mr. Pauley.
Sentence 91: I still stick to the four of those statements.
Sentence 92: [9.]
Sentence 93: Q. Mr. President, will you ask a continuance of the draft?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 94: Yes.
Sentence 95: [10.]
Sentence 96: Q. Mr. President, do you recall whether the subject of return of, or the handing over of the Turkish provinces of Kars and Ardahan to Russia, ever came up at Potsdam?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: Ask that question again.
Sentence 98: I didn't hear it all.
Sentence 99: Q.
Sentence 100: I wonder, sir, if you would recall if the matter of handing over the Turkish provinces of Kars and Ardahan to Russia ever came up at Potsdam?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: No, it did not.
Sentence 102: [11.]
Sentence 103: Q. Mr. President, do you have any plans, if Russia declines to withdraw from Iran?
Sentence 104: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 105: That is a matter that will be handled when it comes up.
Sentence 106: Q.
Sentence 107: If Russian refuses to withdraw, Mr. President, do you think that that means that the United Nations Organization is likely to collapse?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: No, I do not.
Sentence 109: The United Nations Organization is not going to collapse.
Sentence 110: We are not going to let it collapse.
Sentence 111: Q. Do you mean, sir, then, that you favor the other nations going ahead with it, even if Russia insists or persists in going down a one-way street on these matters?
Sentence 112: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 113: I don't think Russia is going to go down a one-way street.
Sentence 114: [12.]
Sentence 115: Q. Mr. President, there has been some criticism in the press and in congressional circles that the tripartite declaration on Spain is constituting a possibly dangerous interference in the domestic affairs of another nation.
Sentence 116: Would you comment on that?
Sentence 117: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 118: No, I would not.
Sentence 119: [13.]
Sentence 120: Q. Mr. President, have you made up your mind, sir, on this full employment board membership?

Sentence 130: Q. Mr. President
Q.
Sentence 131: That was to be a five-man board?
Sentence 132: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 133: Somebody there never asks many questions--give him a chance.
Sentence 134: What is it?
Sentence 135: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 136: I just didn't hear what the question was.

Sentence 151: Q. Mr. President, the New York Times has a story this morning that Mr. Paul E. Fitzpatrick, who I believe is State Chairman in New York, has been asked if he would be willing to step into Mr. Hannegan's shoes, in case Mr. Hannegan's health should make him have to retire.
Sentence 152: Could you give us any comment on that?
