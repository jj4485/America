Sentence 1: 1938 Address Barnesville Georgia

Governor Rivers, Senator George, Senator Russell, and my neighbors of Georgia:
Sentence 2: Fourteen years ago a democratic Yankee, a comparatively young man, came to a neighboring county in the State of Georgia, in search of a pool of warm water wherein he might swim his way back to health; and he found it.
Sentence 3: The place—Warm Springs-was at that time a rather dilapidated small summer resort.
Sentence 4: His new neighbors there extended to him the hand of genuine hospitality, welcomed him to their firesides and made him feel so much at home that he built himself a house, bought himself a farm, and has been coming back ever since.
Sentence 5: And he proposes to keep to that good custom.
Sentence 6: I intend coming back very often.
Sentence 7: There was only one discordant note in that first stay of mine at Warm Springs.
Sentence 8: When the first of the month bill came in for electric light for my little cottage, I found that the charge was eighteen cents per kilowatt hour—about four times as much as I was paying in another community, Hyde Park, New York.
Sentence 9: That light bill started my long study of proper public utility charges for electric current, started in my mind the whole subject of getting electricity into farm homes throughout the United States.
Sentence 10: So, my friends, it can be said with a good deal of truth that a little cottage at Warm Springs, Georgia, was the birthplace of the Rural Electrification Administration.
Sentence 11: Six years ago, in 1932, there was much talk about the more widespread and cheaper use of electricity; but it is only since March 4, 1933, that your Government has reduced that talk to practical results.
Sentence 12: Electricity is a modern necessity of life, not a luxury.
Sentence 13: That necessity ought to be found in every village, in every home and on every farm in every part of the United States.
Sentence 14: The dedication of this Rural Electrification Administration project in Georgia today is a symbol of the progress we are making—and we are not going to stop.
Sentence 15: As you know, when I want to go somewhere I generally try to choose the most direct route, but I slipped up this time.
Sentence 16: I wanted to come to Georgia, but I had to come via California, the Galapagos Islands, the Equator, the Panama Canal and Pensacola.
Sentence 17: But, before I left on that trip about a month ago, I invited a group of distinguished, broad-minded Southerners to meet in Washington to discuss the economic conditions and problems of the South.
Sentence 18: When they met, I said to them:
Sentence 19: "My intimate interest in all that concerns the South is, I believe, known to all of you; but this interest is far more than a sentimental attachment born of a considerable residence in your section and of close personal friendship with so many of your people.
Sentence 20: It proceeds even more from my feeling of responsibility toward the whole Nation.
Sentence 21: It is my conviction that the South presents right now the Nation's No. 1 economic problem—the Nation's problem, not merely the South's.
Sentence 22: For we have an economic unbalance in the Nation as a whole, due to this very condition in the South itself.
Sentence 23: "It is an unbalance that can and must be righted for the sake of the South and of the Nation."
Sentence 24: The day before yesterday when I landed in Florida I received the report and the recommendations based on the advice of this distinguished commission.
Sentence 25: This report and the recommendations will be made public in the course of the next day or two; and I hope you will read it.
Sentence 26: It is well said that this report "presents in only a small degree the manifold assets and advantages possessed by the South" because the report is concerned primarily not with boasting about what the South has, but in telling what the South needs.
Sentence 27: It is a short report divided into fifteen short sections; and it covers in a broad way subjects of vital importance, such as economic resources, soil, water, population, private and public income, education, health, housing, labor, ownership and use of land, credit, use of natural resources, industry and purchasing power.
Sentence 28: I am listing those fifteen headings with a definite purpose in mind.
Sentence 29: The very fact that it is necessary to divide the economic needs of the South into fifteen important groups—each one a problem in itself—proves to you and to me that if you and I are to cover the ground effectively, there is no one single simple answer.
Sentence 30: It is true that many obvious needs ought to be attained quickly—such as the reduction of discriminatory freight rates, such as putting a definite floor under industrial wages, such as continuing to raise the purchasing power of the farm population.
Sentence 31: But no one of these things alone, no combination of a few of them, will meet the whole of the problem.
Sentence 32: Talking in fighting terms, we cannot capture one hill and claim to have won the battle, because the battlefront extends over thousands of miles and we must push forward along the whole front at the same time.
Sentence 33: That is why the longer I live, the more am I convinced that there are two types of political leadership which are dangerous to the continuation of broad economic and social progress all along that long battlefront.
Sentence 34: The first type of political leadership which is dangerous to progress is represented by the man who harps on one or two remedies or proposals and claims that these one or two remedies will cure all our ills.
Sentence 35: The other type of dangerous leadership is represented by the man who says that he is in favor of progress but whose record shows that he hinders or hampers or tries to kill new measures of progress.
Sentence 36: He is that type of political leader who tells his friends that he does not like this or that or the other detail; and, at the same time, he utterly fails to offer a substitute that is practical or worthwhile.
Sentence 37: The task of meeting the economic and social needs of the South, on the broad front that is absolutely necessary, calls for public servants whose hearts are sound, whose heads are sane-whose hands are strong, striving everlastingly to better the lot of their fellowmen.
Sentence 38: The report to which I referred is a synopsis-a clear listing of the economic and social problems of the Southland.
Sentence 39: It suggests the many steps that must be taken to solve the problems.
Sentence 40: Some of these steps, it is true, can be taken by state governments, but you will readily realize that action by the states alone, even if such action on the part of many neighboring states could be simultaneous and immediate, would be wholly inadequate.
Sentence 41: The very good reason for that is that most of these problems 'involve interstate relationships, relationships not only among the states of this region but also between each and all of these states and the rest of the Nation.
Sentence 42: It is not an attack on state sovereignty to point out that this national aspect of all these problems requires action by the Federal Government in Washington.
Sentence 43: I do not hesitate to say from long experience that during the past five years there has been a closer and more effective peacetime cooperation between the Governors of the forty-eight states and the President of the United States than at any other time in our whole national history.
Sentence 44: You are familiar enough with the processes of Government to know that the Chief Executive cannot take action on national or regional problems, unless they have been first translated into Acts of Congress passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States.
Sentence 45: Such action by the Congress, it is equally clear, must be vigorously supported by the Senators and Representatives whose constituents are directly concerned with Southern economics and Southern social needs.
Sentence 46: Senators and Congressmen who are not wholeheartedly in sympathy with these needs cannot be expected to give them vigorous support.
Sentence 47: Translating that into more intimate terms, it means that if the people of the State of Georgia want definite action in the Congress of the United States, they must send to that Congress Senators and Representatives who are willing to stand up and fight night and day for Federal statutes drawn to meet actual needs—not something that serves merely to gloss over the evils of the moment for the time being—but laws with teeth in them which go to the root of the problems; which remove the inequities, raise the standards and, over a period of years, give constant improvement to the conditions of human life in this State.
Sentence 48: You, the people of Georgia, in the coming Senatorial primary, for example, have a perfect right to choose any candidate you wish.
Sentence 49: I do not seek to impair that right, and I am not going to impair that right of the people of this State; but because Georgia has been good enough to call me her adopted son and because for many long years I have regarded Georgia as my "other state," I feel no hesitation in telling you what I would do if I could vote here next month.
Sentence 50: I am strengthened in that decision to give you my personal opinion of the coming Senatorial primary by the fact that during the past few weeks I have had many requests from distinguished citizens of Georgia—from people high and low— from the Chief Justice of the highest court of Georgia and many others.
Sentence 51: Let me preface my statement by saying that I have personally known three of the candidates for the United States Senate for many years.
Sentence 52: All of them have had legislative or executive experience as Government servants.
Sentence 53: We may therefore justly consider their records and their public utterances—and we can justly, also, seek to determine for ourselves what is their inward point of view in relationship to present and future problems of government.
Sentence 54: It has been pointed out by writers and speakers who do not analyze public questions very deeply that in passing through the State of Kentucky a month ago I gave as a reason for the reelection of Senator Barkley that he had had very long and successful service in the Congress of the United States and that his opponent did not have that experience.
Sentence 55: In Kentucky, there was no clear-cut issue between a liberal on the one side and a dyed-in-the-wool conservative on the other.
Sentence 56: Neither of the two principals on his record could be classified as a reactionary; therefore, the criterion of experience, especially that of the Majority Leadership of the Senate of the United States, weighed heavily, and properly, in favor of Senator Barkley.
Sentence 57: Here in Georgia, however, my old friend, the senior Senator from this State, cannot possibly in my judgment be classified as belonging to the liberal school of thought—and, therefore, the argument that he has long served in the Senate falls by the wayside.
Sentence 58: Here in Georgia the issue is a different one from that in Kentucky.
Sentence 59: I speak seriously and in the most friendly way in terms of liberal and conservative for the very simple fact that on my shoulders rests a responsibility to the people of the United States.
Sentence 60: In 1932 and again in 1936 I was chosen Chief Executive with the mandate to seek by definite action to correct many evils of the past and of the present; to work for a wider distribution of national income, to improve the conditions of life, especially among those who need it most and, above all, to use every honest effort to keep America in the van of social and economic progress.
Sentence 61: To the Congress of the United States I make recommendations-that is all—in most cases recommendations relating to objectives, leaving it to the Congress to translate the recommendations into law.
Sentence 62: The majority of the Senate and House have agreed with those objectives, and have worked with me; and I have worked with them to translate those objectives into action.
Sentence 63: Some have given "lip service" to some of the objectives but have not raised their little fingers actively to attain the objectives themselves.
Sentence 64: Too often these few have listened to the dictatorship of a small minority-of individuals and corporations who oppose the objectives themselves.
Sentence 65: That is a real dictatorship and one which we have been getting away from slowly but surely during the past five years.
Sentence 66: As long as I live, you will find me fighting against any kind of dictatorship—especially the kind of dictatorship which has enslaved many of our fellow citizens for more than half a century.
Sentence 67: What I am about to say will be no news, to my old friend-and I say it with the utmost sincerity—Senator Walter George.
Sentence 68: It will be no surprise to him because I have recently had personal correspondence with him; and, as a result of it, he fully knows what my views are.
Sentence 69: Let me make it clear that he is, and I hope always will be, my personal friend.
Sentence 70: He is beyond question, beyond any possible question, a gentleman and a scholar; but there are other gentlemen in the Senate and in the House for whom I have a real affectionate regard, but with whom I differ heartily and sincerely on the principles and policies of how the Government of the United States ought to be run.
Sentence 71: For example, I have had an almost lifelong acquaintance and great personal friendship for people like Senator Hale from the State of Maine, for Representative James Wadsworth of New York and for the Minority Leader, Representative Snell.
Sentence 72: All of these lifelong conservative Republicans are gentlemen and scholars; but they and I learned long ago that our views on public questions were just as wide apart as the North Pole and the South.
Sentence 73: Therefore, I repeat that I trust, and am confident, that Senator George and I shall always be good personal friends even though I am impelled to make it clear that on most public questions he and I do not speak the same language.
Sentence 74: To carry out my responsibility as President, it is clear that if there is to be_ success in our Government there ought to be cooperation between members of my own party and myself—cooperation, in other words, within the majority party, between one branch of Government, the Legislative branch, and the head of the other branch, the Executive.
Sentence 75: That is one of the essentials of a party form of government.
Sentence 76: It has been going on in this country for nearly a century and a half.
Sentence 77: The test is not measured, in the case of an individual, by his every vote on every bill—of course not.
Sentence 78: The test lies rather in the answer to two questions: first, has the record of the candidate shown, while differing perhaps in details, a constant active fighting attitude in favor of the broad objectives of the party and of the Government as they are constituted today; and, secondly, does the candidate really, in his heart, deep down in his heart, believe in those objectives?
Sentence 79: I regret that in the case of my friend, Senator George, I cannot honestly answer either of these questions in the affirmative.
Sentence 80: In the case of another candidate in the State of Georgia for the United States Senate— former Governor Talmadge— I have known him for many years.
Sentence 81: His attitude toward me and toward other members of the Government in 1935 and in 1936 concerns me not at all.
Sentence 82: But, in those years and in this year I have read so many of his proposals, so many of his promises, so many of his panaceas, that I am very certain in my own mind that his election would contribute very little to practical progress in government.
Sentence 83: That is all I can say about him.
Sentence 84: The third candidate that I would speak of, United States Attorney Lawrence Camp, I have also known for many years.
Sentence 85: He has had experience in the State Legislature; he has served as Attorney General of Georgia and for four years; he has made a distinguished record in the United States District Court, his office ranking among the first two in the whole of the United States in the expedition of Federal cases in that Court.
Sentence 86: I regard him not only as a public servant with successful experience but as a man who honestly believes that many things must be done and done now to improve the economic and social conditions of the country, a man who is willing to fight for these objectives.
Sentence 87: Fighting ability is of the utmost importance.
Sentence 88: Therefore, answering the requests that have come to me from many leading citizens of Georgia that I make my position clear, I have no hesitation in saying that if I were able to vote in the September primaries in this State, I most assuredly should cast my ballot for Lawrence Camp.
Sentence 89: In dedicating this important project today, I want to express once more my abiding faith that we as a nation are moving steadily and surely toward a better way of living for all of our people.
Sentence 90: This electrification project is a symbol of our determination to attain that objective.
Sentence 91: But it is only one symbol; it is one hill out of ten thousand which must be captured.
Sentence 92: You and I will never be satisfied until all our economic inequalities are corrected, until every one of us, North, East, West and South has the opportunity so to live, that his education, his job and his home will be secure.
Sentence 93: In many countries democracy is under attack by those who charge that democracy fails to provide its people with the needs of modern civilization.
Sentence 94: I do not, you do not, subscribe to that charge.
Sentence 95: You and I, we, the people of this State and the people of all the states, believe that democracy today is succeeding, but that an absolute necessity for its future success is the fighting spirit of the American people—their insistence that we go forward and not back.
