Sentence 35: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 36: That's right.
Sentence 37: Q.
Sentence 38: What do you consider the middle and upper brackets?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 39: The Treasury considers the middle and upper brackets begin about $6,000 a year, from there up to about $25,000 or $30,000 a year.
Sentence 40: It's a matter of point of view.
Sentence 41: If you are getting $6,000 a year, you probably would consider $10,000 the--[Laughter]
Sentence 42: Q. Mr. President, the point that brings this up is that President Roosevelt, I believe, held the view that incomes ought to level off about $25,000 a year, and that ought to be about the maximum take-home pay.
Sentence 43: Is that your view also?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: I have no set view on the subject.
Sentence 45: I think if a man has got brains enough to know enough about the tax laws of the United States to make more than $25,000 a year, he is probably entitled to make it.

Sentence 51: 4
This refers to different approaches to the problem of repealing the Taft-Hartley Act and substituting an amended Wagner Act in its place.

Sentence 62: [8.]

Sentence 66: It isn't true?
Sentence 67: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 68: It isn't true.
Sentence 69: Our position on the Palestine situation was stated on November 20th by Mr. Jessup before the Assembly in Paris.
Sentence 70: 6
That is as clear a statement as it could possibly be.
Sentence 71: That is as far as it is necessary to go, if you will read that statement by Mr. Jessup before the Assembly on November 20th.
Sentence 72: 6
The statement on Palestine made in the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly by Philip C. Jessup, United States delegate to the General Assembly, is published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 19, p. 657).

Q. Mr. President, aside from that--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 77: Wait a minute--let this young man go ahead.
Sentence 78: Q.--I was just going to ask whether you would give us some guidance as to whether we would be wise to assume that?
Sentence 79: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, some London newspaper dispatches today have said that the United States has given assurance to Britain that we will back with military action any action that they deem necessary in the Middle East.

Sentence 82: I have no comment to make on that.

Sentence 86: I want you to read the statement before the United Nations Assembly as to our position on Palestine, and it will answer every question you have asked me.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 88: Yes.
Sentence 89: Q. Well, did you make that suggestion when the gentleman asked you about the reconnaissance planes?
Sentence 90: Did that--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: Oh, no--oh, no.
Sentence 92: The reconnaissance planes--there wasn't a word of truth in that at all.
Sentence 93: Q.
Sentence 94: You immediately followed it by saying Jessup's statement covered everything.
Sentence 95: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: Jessup's statement covers everything in connection with our statement on the situation in the Near East, and that is being handled by a United Nations Commission now, of which we are a member.
Sentence 97: That is the reason I am not commenting on these questions.
Sentence 98: [9.]
Sentence 99: Q. Mr. President, would you comment on the reports that Rabbi Samuel Thurman would be named--nominated as Ambassador to Israel?

Sentence 122: Do you know for sure that there were objections to Dr. Frank Graham?
Sentence 123: I have the utmost confidence in Dr. Frank Graham.

Sentence 136: No, I can't.
