Sentence 19: [3.]

Sentence 23: [4.]

Sentence 34: You have been invited to Roanoke Island, N.C.
Sentence 35: Are you planning to go down there any time--

Sentence 38: I would like to go.
Sentence 39: I have been invited on these occasions in the past, for the same purpose, and couldn't go, but I would like to go if I could.
Sentence 40: Q. Mr. President, if you went to South Carolina, you will perhaps go to Oak Ridge and Knoxville and some of those--

Sentence 48: The Senate Foreign--Foreign Relations Committee
Q. Appropriations Committee.
Sentence 49: THE PRESIDENT.--Appropriations Committee has a perfect right to ask for the presence of General MacArthur, if he can give them any information that will be valuable to them.

Sentence 63: [8.]
Sentence 64: Q. In the civil rights message you said you had given instructions to end discrimination in the Armed Forces.
Sentence 65: The word from the Hill now seems to be that the draft bill is in jeopardy because of that instruction.
Sentence 66: For instance, the Russell amendment has been introduced which would permit a Negro to request that he be assigned to a unit of Negro troops only, which would of course offset your instructions.
Sentence 67: Are you apt to modify those instructions, or leave--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 68: I can't comment on the legislation because it has not been formulated.
Sentence 69: You never can tell what a bill is going to be.

Sentence 77: 1
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 89: [12.]
Sentence 90: Q. Mr. President, do you favor registration of the Communist Party and its members?
Sentence 91: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: I'll comment on that when the bill comes before me.
Sentence 93: Q.
Sentence 94: In that regard, Mr. President, this morning Attorney General Clark handed down an administrative ruling to the effect that the Hatch Act prohibits Communists from holding Federal jobs, and he further stated definitely that the Communist Party does advocate the overthrow of the United States Government by force and violence.

Sentence 97: [13.]

Sentence 99: Secretary Forrestal reported that you and he approved it.
Sentence 100: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: It was recommended in the last Budget Message.
Sentence 102: I signed that message, so undoubtedly it was an approval.
Sentence 103: [14.]
Sentence 104: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us anything about the status of requests from the Jewish State of Palestine for a loan of $90 or $100 million?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 105: So far as I know, no application has been made.
Sentence 106: If one is made, it will be handled in the usual manner and through the usual departments.
Sentence 107: [15.]
Sentence 108: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us anything about the occasions on which you asked General MacArthur to return to Washington?
Sentence 109: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 110: When General MacArthur signed the surrender document in Japan, I invited him to come home and accept a medal out here on the lawn.
Sentence 111: Admiral Nimitz, General Wainwright, General Marshall, and General Eisenhower have accepted, and he wired me that conditions were such that he thought he should remain in Japan.
Sentence 112: On another occasion, a year or so after that, I told him that at his discretion I would be happy to have him return to the country and pay a visit to his relatives and his friends, and also pay a visit to the White House along the lines that the other commanders had paid to the White House.
Sentence 113: And the same answer was returned by General MacArthur.
Sentence 114: Q.
Sentence 115: That was about a year later, you said?
Sentence 116: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: That was about a year later, I judge.
Sentence 118: Q.
Sentence 119: He said he was too busy?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: No, no, he didn't think it was proper for him to leave at that time, and being he was there on the spot, he had entire discretion in the matter.
Sentence 121: He was not ordered to come home.
Sentence 122: It was just merely an invitation.
Sentence 123: Q. Mr. President, as Commander in Chief you don't feel disposed to order him to come home?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 124: That is not necessary.
Sentence 125: Q. No.
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 126: He is in absolute control out there on the order that I gave.
Sentence 127: And you can't interfere with things of that sort, if you are going to have operation of it.
Sentence 128: I believe in delegating the authority and then backing the man up.
Sentence 129: And that is what we have done with General MacArthur.
Sentence 130: Q.
Sentence 131: In substance, you will be very happy for him to come here and testify?
Sentence 132: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 133: Certainly.
Sentence 134: If it is proper for him to leave Japan to testify before the Appropriations Committee, that is perfectly proper.
Sentence 135: [16.]
Sentence 136: Q. Mr. President, among your various requests to Congress, is there any so important that if you do not get them you might call them back into special session?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 137: Well, I will answer that as to the condition of the country at the time, just as I did last fall.
Sentence 138: I can't answer that now.
Sentence 139: [17.]
Sentence 140: Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on the settlement of the labor dispute between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 141: The only comment I have to make is that I am glad the dispute was settled by collective bargaining.
Sentence 142: Q.
Sentence 143: Do you feel that the wage increase which General Motors granted will have an inflationary effect?

Sentence 146: [18.]
Sentence 147: Q. Mr. President, would you like to comment on the selection of Mr. Joe L. Blythe as Democratic Treasurer?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 148: No, I have no comment.
Sentence 149: I know he must be all right, or Mr. McGrath wouldn't have selected him.
Sentence 150: [19.]
Sentence 151: Q. Mr. President, there is a report, recently published in a West Coast labor publication, that you are making it easy for Labor Secretary Schwellenbach to retire from the Cabinet by urging him to remain in the hospital?
Sentence 152: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 153: That's a lie out of the whole cloth.
Sentence 154: [20.]
Sentence 155: Q. Mr. President, it just occurred to me that perhaps you might have some report on the investigation of alleged Communist activities--disloyal activities within the Atomic Energy Commission, in particular at Oak Ridge and Hanford and at--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 156: I have no information on that.
Sentence 157: Q. Did you order the investigation, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 158: The investigation as ordered was at the time--very early in the game.
Sentence 159: There has been no report on it.
Sentence 160: There is no disloyalty there.
Sentence 161: [21.]
Sentence 162: Q. Mr. President, did Dr. Weizmann suggest a loan to Israel?
Sentence 163: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 164: He did not suggest a loan.
Sentence 165: He said he would like to have a loan, just like every other country.
Sentence 166: [Laughter] If you know of any other country that wouldn't like to have a loan, I wish you would name them.
Sentence 167: Q. Did he suggest the amount?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 168: He did not.
Sentence 169: We did not go into details.
Sentence 170: We talked about the question just as with you gentlemen here this afternoon.
Sentence 171: Q. Is there any way financial aid could be extended to the Jewish State other than by special act of Congress?
Sentence 172: Are there any funds or any appropriations which we could use without consulting Congress?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 173: There is the Export-Import Bank, and there is the World Bank.
Sentence 174: They make loans of that kind all the time.
Sentence 175: Q. Mr. President, Dr. Weizmann said that he wanted part of that loan to be used for tanks and antitank guns?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 176: He did not discuss the details with me.
Sentence 177: All I know about it is what he says in the paper.
Sentence 178: Q. Well, that obviously would not come under the Export-Import Bank?
Sentence 179: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 180: I can't answer the question.
Sentence 181: Those sources of supply are for money in this country as well as the Treasury of the United States.
Sentence 182: Q. Did Dr. Weizmann say what he wanted the loan for?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 183: He did not.
Sentence 184: He said he wanted a loan.
Sentence 185: Period.
Sentence 186: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 187: What did you say?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 188: You have to have that?
Sentence 189: [More laughter] I simply told him that if the loan was necessary, after the state was fully in existence, he would have to go through the usual channels that such things go through.
Sentence 190: [22.]
Sentence 191: Q. Mr. President, regarding the arms embargo shipments to Israel, the British, as I understand it, are shipping arms to the Arabs.
Sentence 192: What is the difference between the position of the British and our position?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 193: I don't know that there should be any difference.
Sentence 194: Q. Well, is the United Nations stopping us from shipping arms to them?
Sentence 195: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 196: The United Nations Council requested an arms embargo several months ago, and we have complied with the request, in the interests of peace and to prevent bloodshed, and that request is still in effect.
Sentence 197: Q. Well, did they also ask the British not to ship--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 198: I don't know about that.
Sentence 199: You will have to look up the record of the United Nations Security Council.
Sentence 200: Q. Parallel case?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 201: I don't think so.
Sentence 202: I think we are in much better shape to ship arms than any other country.
Sentence 203: Q.
Sentence 204: Do you propose that the United States initiate in the United Nations a reconsideration of this--
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 214: Thank you, Mr. President.
