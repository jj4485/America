Sentence 1: 1930 The Presidents News Conference 786

FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION LEGISLATION
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have a question on the legislation affecting the Federal Power Commission.
Sentence 3: 1
I am very much gratified that this legislation has advanced to the point of being passed by both Houses.
Sentence 4: There is some little different between the two bills, which will require to be planned out in conference, but it is a most important step, and rendered necessary by the fact that the work and burden of the Power commission has become entirely too great for administration by three Cabinet officers who have many other duties and troubles.
Sentence 5: The establishment of the Commission on an independent and fixed basis with its own Commissioners not only will allow the back work to be caught up but a better administration of the Water Power Act.
Sentence 6: And possibly more important, it furnishes the foundation for consideration of the many problems growing out of conservation and dealing generally with the Federal Government's relation to waterpower.
Sentence 7: I regard it as a very important administrative step.
Sentence 8: 1 The act to reorganize the Federal Power Commission (S. 3619) was approved on June 23, 1930 (Public, No. 412, 46 Stat.
Sentence 9: 797)
CIVIL WAR VETERANS' PENSION BILL
I have also been glad to sign this morning two other bills of importance--one for the Civil War veterans,
2
signed last night as a matter of fact--giving an increase in allowance there for totally disabled veterans, those that require constant attention and care, and for some little increase in pensions to widows.
Sentence 10: Both of them I think will commend themselves to the country in general.
Sentence 11: As far as the Civil War veterans are concerned they theoretically have only 3 years more to last.
2 The Civil War Veterans Act (H.R. 12013), approved June 9, 1930, is Public, No. 323 (46 Stat. 529).
Sentence 12: That bill does not vary the previous practice of the Government in any respect in dealing with pension questions.
Sentence 13: PERISHABLE AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES ACT
Another rather important measure this morning is the new marketing act for licensing dealers in perishable commodities,
3
in order to prevent interfering practices in dealing with perishables.
Sentence 14: It is a very important agricultural bill.
Sentence 15: I have advocated it for some years.
Sentence 16: It has been supported by the great majority of the commission men and dealers in agricultural perishables, as well as the agricultural organizations of the country.
Sentence 17: 3
Sentence 18: The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930 (S. 108) is Public, No. 325 (46 Stat.531.)
Sentence 19: It is a very important step in protection both to the farmer and to the honest dealer and to the consumer.
Sentence 20: It has not had a great deal of public attention, but it is a notable accomplishment.
Sentence 21: TEXTILE FOUNDATION BILL
Q. Mr. President, also did you sign the textile bill this morning ?
Sentence 22: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 23: Yes, I have signed the bill on the Textile Foundation.
Sentence 24: 4
That bill originates in the war organization of the Textile Alliance, as I recollect, which operations made profits during the war, which should be set aside for some sort of educational or scientific purpose.
Sentence 25: I think it is 5 years ago since I first recommended to Congress that that should be established as a definite foundation for that purpose and set up under an independent Board of Trustees with some representation from the Government, purely for research and educational purposes connected with the development of the textile industry.
Sentence 26: I have not as yet had a return on the amount available, but I think it is $1,400,000.
Sentence 27: Do you know what it is ?
Sentence 28: 4 The Textile Foundation Act (H.R. 9557), approved June 10, 1930, is Public, No. 329 (46 Stat. 539).
Sentence 29: Q. No, Mr. President, I do not.
Sentence 30: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 31: It may form a nucleus for collecting further funds for that purpose, all of which represents a useful step in the development of scientific research in connection with industry.
Sentence 32: It is more or less a monument to the fact that if you keep after things long enough you will get them done in time.
Sentence 33: It has been a long process.
Sentence 34: That is all I have this morning except bridge bills, of which we have the usual supply.
