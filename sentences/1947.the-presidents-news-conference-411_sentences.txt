Sentence 1: 1947 The Presidents News Conference 411

THE President.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I have no particular announcements to make today, except that we found some interesting receipts and documents signed by President Lincoln and Mrs. Lincoln in reference to some of the White House furniture about which there had been controversy.
Sentence 4: So anybody who is interested in those controversies will be welcome to take a look at these papers.
Sentence 5: All I am open to now is questions.
Sentence 6: [2.]
Sentence 7: Q. Mr. President, this statement was made today--and we would like your comment-it was made by Secretary of Agriculture Anderson in a press conference
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 8: I have no comment.
Sentence 9: Q.
Sentence 10: You know what the statement was ?
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 12: No, I do not.
Sentence 13: I have heard about it, but I have no comment on it because I haven't read the statement, so I can't possibly make a comment on it.
Sentence 14: If you want to ask me any specific questions on it, I might answer from my own viewpoint, but I can't â€¢ comment on Anderson.
Sentence 15: [3.]
Sentence 16: Q. Mr. President, do you consider meatless days of no importance in themselves but merely reminders?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 17: The meatless days and the eggless days are for the purpose of saving grain, which is of vital importance, because it is expensive to feed grain to poultry and livestock; and when you save meat and save poultry products you save grain, and grain is what is necessary to meet the hunger situation in Europe.
Sentence 18: It is the most economical way to meet it.
Sentence 19: [4.]
Sentence 20: Q. Mr. President, did you and Mr. Blythe1 discuss the next year's election today ?
Sentence 21: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 22: We did not.

Sentence 24: 1 Joe Blythe, National Democratic Committeeman from North Carolina.
Sentence 25: [5.]
Sentence 26: Q. Is it correct, sir, that General Spaatz is being considered for Chief of Staff to succeed General Eisenhower?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 27: I have no comment to make on that.
Sentence 28: I never comment on people I am considering for a job.
Sentence 29: I will let you know when I make the appointment.
Sentence 30: Q. Does that mean you are considering it?
Sentence 31: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 32: I have no comment.
Sentence 33: I don't like questions like that, either.
Sentence 34: Q. I'm sorry.
Sentence 35: [6.]
Sentence 36: Q. Mr. President, since your return from South America, have you had a chance to do anything about the fight among the California Democrats?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 37: No, I have not.
Sentence 38: That fight was going on before I left, and I have never taken any part in it.
Sentence 39: I am not interested in Democrats fighting.
Sentence 40: I want harmony in the Democratic Party.
Sentence 41: [7.]
Sentence 42: Q. Mr. President, would you say what importance you attach to the rebirth of the Comintern?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 43: I think that was amply commented on yesterday by Secretary Lovett.
Sentence 44: And I want to reiterate again my viewpoint, that all this country has ever wanted is a lasting peace in the world, and prosperity in the world for the benefit of all the countries in the world.
Sentence 45: We have no--we have never asked for territory.
Sentence 46: We are not interested in the economic control of any country or any continent.
Sentence 47: Q. Mr. President, how do you feel about the recent Russian propaganda, like in the newspapers.--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 48: That is just like the propaganda here at home.
Sentence 49: I am used to it.
Sentence 50: [Laughter] They got most of their information out of the papers here at home that have been in the political campaigns.
Sentence 51: [8.]
Sentence 52: Q. Mr. President, the Housing Administrator today approved a 5-percent rent increase in Louisville, the first in the country.
Sentence 53: Have you any comment on that?
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: The only information I have on that is that the law provides--and I think I sent out a statement when it was signed--that these rent committees are locally appointed by the Governor of the State in which they operate, and that the Housing Expediter has no discretion except to accept their recommendations.
Sentence 56: [9.]
Sentence 57: Q. Mr. President, it has been reported that the White House has issued orders for a resurvey of possible stopgap aid--sources of money--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: Well, that--it's a resurvey that has been going on ever since this proposition came up.
Sentence 59: We are still making an effort to find every dollar we can to meet the situation.
Sentence 60: My viewpoint on the subject hasn't changed a bit from that last answer I gave you on the subject, that I didn't think it would last beyond December 1st.
Sentence 61: Q. Has that search met with any great success so far?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 62: I can't answer the question.
Sentence 63: I am in the same frame of mind when I talked to you before.
Sentence 64: [10.]
Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, some fear has been expressed by labor unions that this action of the Louisville rent advisory board is going to set a pattern for rent increases all over the country.
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: I can't comment.
Sentence 68: I can't comment on that.
Sentence 69: I am telling you what the law provides.
Sentence 70: If you get out the law and read it, you will see exactly where the Expediter stands and where the administration stands.
Sentence 71: I would advise you to read my comment on the law when it was signed.

Sentence 86: Q. What about the Truman earrings?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: I saw that picture in the paper this afternoon.
Sentence 88: I have no comment to make on it.
Sentence 89: Q.
Sentence 90: You don't disapprove of those earrings, do you?

Sentence 92: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 93: You mean you don't take a position on long skirts?

Sentence 97: Q. Mr. President, on that stuff you referred to there, about the Lincoln furniture, what is there to that?
Sentence 98: Are there now any historic pieces or any authentic pieces?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 99: Oh yes.
Sentence 100: There is a rosewood bed over there, known as the Lincoln bed, and two dressers and a desk, and four Cabinet chairs, which are authentic, and are proven to be authentic by these bills which I have just run across in the file of the General Accounting Office.
Sentence 101: They are right interesting to anyone who is interested in that.
Sentence 102: Q. Is there anything else you can tell us about them of an interesting nature?

Sentence 108: Q.
Sentence 109: What did the Lincoln bed cost, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 110: Three hundred and seventy-five dollars.
Sentence 111: About the fourth item from the top.
Sentence 112: Q. Had you been searching for these documents, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT, NO, no.
Sentence 113: I am interested in everything of that sort, if it has anything to do with the White House, of course; and we accidentally ran across these Cabinet chairs which we had reupholstered and brought over to the House.
Sentence 114: And they are just exactly like the ones in the Brady picture of the Lincoln Cabinet, so I am sure that they are authentic.
Sentence 115: Q. Mr. President, was there any indication that Mr. Lincoln said that $375 was too much for a bed ?
Sentence 116: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: No.
Sentence 118: He OK'd a bill for some $2600 there.

Sentence 120: [13.]
Sentence 121: Q. Mr. President, have you taken any steps to aid France in this present situation, in which they are asking for help between now and the stopgap aid ?

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 130: I can't answer the question.
Sentence 131: I don't know.
Sentence 132: What I am after is 10 million bushels of grain, to feed hungry people, from the distilleries.
Sentence 133: [15.]
Sentence 134: Q. Mr. President, do you feel, on the basis of the recent Russian revival of the Comintern, that American aid to Western Europe assumes that much more of the character of urgency?
Sentence 135: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 136: Well, it has always been urgent.
Sentence 137: I don't think it's any more urgent, no matter what anybody did.
Sentence 138: It's just as urgent now as it was in the beginning.
Sentence 139: [16.]

Representative J. Parnell Thomas of New Jersey.
Sentence 143: [17.]
Sentence 144: Q. Mr. President, if we might get back on this rent control subject just a moment, your statement at the time pointed out the shortcomings of that rent bill.
Sentence 145: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 146: That's right.
Sentence 147: Q.
Sentence 148: And it seems to me you said that there should be public hearings before these local boards recommending rent increases.
Sentence 149: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: I think that is correct.
Sentence 151: I can't quote that statement exactly, but I am sure that was in it, and that the local people themselves would have to be careful to look after their recommendations and see that people went on that board that were not prejudiced one way or the other.
Sentence 152: Q.
Sentence 153: Yes sir.
Sentence 154: Well, in the Louisville case there was no public gathering, and Mr. Creedon OK'd that rent increase.
Sentence 155: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 156: I don't think Mr. Creedon had any discretion in the matter, if you read the law.
Sentence 157: Q. Well, one of the reports said Mr. Creedon has decided to not permit any publicity on the recommendations--for the recommendations from the rent control board, which seems to me would interfere with the people making their
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 160: [18.]
Sentence 161: Q. Mr. President, should the distillers as a whole refuse to cut down, is there any means that the Government might use
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 162: I don't think they will refuse.
Sentence 163: [19.]
