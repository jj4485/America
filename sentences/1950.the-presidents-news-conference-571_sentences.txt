Sentence 1: 1950 The Presidents News Conference 571

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I will explain to you why I was late.
Sentence 4: The President of Chile was our guest last night at the Blair House, and it is necessary for the President to see the distinguished guests away from the Blair House when they leave.
Sentence 5: We were a little late making the arrangements, hence you had to wait 10 minutes--which doesn't happen very often.
Sentence 6: I have no announcements to make.
Sentence 7: If you have any questions, I will listen to them.
Sentence 8: [2.]
Sentence 9: Q. Mr. President, Charles Binaggio and Charles Gargotta were both witnesses before a Federal grand jury in Kansas City probing rackets.
Sentence 10: Now, 8 days after they were killed,
1
the Attorney General apparently has not found legal authority to bring the FBI into the investigation.
Sentence 11: Governor Smith, I understand, wired the FBI for allout assistance, immediately after the killings.
Sentence 12: I have two questions to ask, sir: one, do you think this is a Federal matter; and two, will you ask the Attorney General to send the FBI--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 13: That is a matter for the Attorney General himself to determine.
Sentence 14: The grand jury was called in Kansas City at my suggestion to the Attorney General several months ago.
Sentence 15: 1
Charles Binaggio and Charles Gargotta were found shot to death at the First Ward Democratic Club in Kansas City, Mo., on the morning of April 6, 1950.
Sentence 16: Both men had testified before a special Federal grand jury in Kansas City that had been called to investigate nationwide crime and vice.
Sentence 17: [3.]
Sentence 18: Q. Mr. President, are you in agreement with the Attorney General, who has been quoted as saying that all forms of segregation are discriminatory ?
Sentence 19: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 20: I think we have been working for that for some time past.
Sentence 21: Haven't you read any of my messages on that subject?
Sentence 22: Q.
Sentence 23: Yes sir, but they didn't cover that, I don't think, and--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 24: When you read the messages you will get the plain answer.
Sentence 25: [4.]
Sentence 26: Q. Mr. President, have you discussed the Binaggio case with the Attorney General?
Sentence 27: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 28: I have not.
Sentence 29: It is not in my jurisdiction.
Sentence 30: I have not discussed it with them and don't expect to discuss it with them.
Sentence 31: Q. Mr. President, when Senator Lucas was here the other day, did he discuss the crime situation in general with you?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 32: No, he did not.
Sentence 33: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us any more about the request that you made which resulted in the calling of the grand jury in Kansas City--anything on the scope of the investigation that you ordered?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 34: The scope of the investigation was to, if possible, get to the bottom of these national rackets.
Sentence 35: And the Attorney General called the grand jury at my suggestion for that purpose.
Sentence 36: The rackets are nationwide, they are not confined to Kansas City or St. Louis or--there are as many in St. Louis as there are in Kansas City.
Sentence 37: They are in every big city in the country, even in Washington, if I am not mistaken.
Sentence 38: [5.]
Sentence 39: Q. Mr. President, do you wish to comment on the recent visit to Washington--the presence of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Cereijo of Argentina, who has been here--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 40: I have no comment to make on that.
Sentence 41: I did see the Finance Minister.
Sentence 42: I understand that he went away from here highly pleased with the result of his visit.
Sentence 43: [6.]
Sentence 44: Q. When you spoke of calling the grand jury at your suggestion, do you mean just the grand jury in Kansas City?
Sentence 45: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 46: Just the grand jury in Kansas City.
Sentence 47: Q. Weren't there grand juries in a good many other cities at the same time?
Sentence 48: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 49: Yes.
Sentence 50: Grand juries were already in session in several other cities, and I suggested one be called in Kansas City and one for St. Louis.
Sentence 51: The one for St. Louis I don't think was called.
Sentence 52: Q.
Sentence 53: You meant it to be nationwide in scope?
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: Yes, I meant it to be nationwide in scope.
Sentence 56: Q.
Sentence 57: You meant it to be that?
Sentence 58: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 59: That is exactly right.
Sentence 60: [7.]
Sentence 61: Q. Mr. President, that grand jury doesn't have anything to do with the theft of the ballot boxes, does it?
2
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 62: Not this.
Sentence 63: 2
The vault of the Kansas City Board of Election Commissioners in the Jackson County Courthouse in Kansas City, Mo., was broken into during the night of May 27--28, 1947, and the contents of three metal ballot boxes, containing ballots, poll books, and tally sheets, were stolen.
Sentence 64: The articles had been returned to the vault the day before after being used as evidence by a State grand jury in a 2-month investigation of alleged vote manipulation in the August 1946 primary election.
Sentence 65: Q. Have you discussed that with the Attorney General?
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: I have not.
Sentence 68: Q.
Sentence 69: You realize that the Statute of Limitations will run in this case?
Sentence 70: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 71: I don't know anything about it.
Sentence 72: [8.]
Sentence 73: Q. Did you have a good visit with the President of Chile last night, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: Very good visit.
Sentence 75: That is quite a jump from St. Louis to Santiago, Chile, isn't it?
Sentence 76: [Laughter]
Q. Did you take up any economic or political subjects ?
Sentence 77: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: I did not.
Sentence 79: The President of Chile is coming to pay an official call on me at 4 o'clock this afternoon, and we shall discuss any subject in which he is interested.
Sentence 80: [9.]
Sentence 81: Q. Mr. President, Senator Taft said this week that you had libeled Senator McCarthy.
Sentence 82: Would you care to make any comment?
Sentence 83: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: Do you think that is possible?
Sentence 85: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 86: May we quote that?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: Yes.
Sentence 88: Q. Well, Mr. President, are you aware of what Senator Taft said ?
Sentence 89: He wrote a whole column for his Ohio paper.
Sentence 90: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: I haven't read Senator Taft's column, and I do not make it my business to read political publications of people who are running for office
Q. Would you repeat that for us?
Sentence 92: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 93: --particularly in one statement.
Sentence 94: Q.
Sentence 95: It was a general criticism of the administration's attitude
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: That would be natural for Senator Taft.
Sentence 97: He is running for reelection in Ohio, and I suppose he has something else in mind a couple of years from now.
Sentence 98: [Laughter]
Q. Yes.
Sentence 99: I thought you were interested, perhaps, in this year's campaign.
Sentence 100: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: I am very much interested in it.
Sentence 102: [10.]
Sentence 103: Q. Mr. President, can we get back to the Missouri matter, not related to
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: Anything.
Sentence 105: I told you you could ask any questions and I will answer all I Can.
Sentence 106: Q.
Sentence 107: Do you have any comment on Governor Smith's gasoline tax proposal--this is a double-barreled question--would you care to say if you voted for or against
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: I don't think it's anybody's business how I voted, but I was for the increase in the tax
Sentence 109: and I voted for it.
Sentence 110: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 111: Any comment on the defeat?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 112: I have no comment on the
defeat.
Sentence 113: The people of Missouri just simply didn't want it, I reckon.
Sentence 114: They overwhelmingly thought that they didn't want it.
Sentence 115: [11.]
Sentence 116: Q. Mr. President, I see Myron Taylor is on the calling list today.
Sentence 117: Do you intend to reappoint him to the Vatican?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 118: I have no comment on that
Sentence 119: and I do not intend to comment on that this morning.
Sentence 120: Mr. Taylor is here on private business of his own.
Sentence 121: [12.]
Sentence 122: Q. Mr. President, I would like to revert to the one last question--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 123: Shoot all the questions you want.
Sentence 124: Q.
Sentence 125: In your opinion, could you construe the murder of the two Federal witnesses as tampering with witnesses before a Federal grand jury?
Sentence 126: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 127: I am not in the legal buisness, and you can make your own construction on that.
Sentence 128: [13.]
Sentence 129: Q. Mr. President, Senator Tobey says he is asking you to name a New Englander to the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Sentence 130: I wonder if you plan to do that?
Sentence 131: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 132: What's that?
Sentence 133: Q. Senator Tobey was down here and asked you to name a New England man to the ICC.
Sentence 134: I wonder if you plan to do that?
Sentence 135: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 136: Senator Tobey made a recommendation for the ICC, and he will have the same consideration that several dozen other people have that have been recommended to me from all parts of the United States.
Sentence 137: There are other Sates in the Union as well as New Hampshire.
Sentence 138: [14.]
Sentence 139: Q. Mr. President, several groups, including Republicans, are protesting the delay in action on FEPC until the foreign aid measure is acted on.
Sentence 140: Can you comment on that?
Sentence 141: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 142: Yes, I can comment on it.
Sentence 143: The reason for the postponement was due to the fact that the ECA appropriation should get into the omnibus appropriation bill in the House.
Sentence 144: Unless it is passed promptly, it will not get into that omnibus bill.
Sentence 145: The FEPC will be carried to the logical conclusion, and every effort will be made to pass FEPC promptly without starting a filibuster against an international matter that is of vital importance to the whole world.
Sentence 146: [15.]
Sentence 147: Q. Mr. President, some months ago you outlined for us a nationwide program of river valley development, and you astounded us with your knowledge of river geography.
Sentence 148: Have any steps been taken in the direction of fulfilling that program?
Sentence 149: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: Surveys are being made, and I have some preliminary reports on it.
Sentence 151: Q.
Sentence 152: That is in the Missouri Valley
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 153: HOW'S that ?
Sentence 154: Q.
Sentence 155: That is the Missouri Valley?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 156: The whole Mississippi Valley--Pittsburgh to Denver, and from Minneapolis to New Orleans.
Sentence 157: [16.]
Sentence 158: Q. Have you been personally reviewing the necessary preliminaries for our responsibilities in the forthcoming reciprocal trade talks?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 159: Yes, I have.
Sentence 160: Q. Have you completed that?
Sentence 161: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 162: Not quite.
Sentence 163: [17.]
Sentence 164: Q. Do you think the first 5 years are the hardest?
Sentence 165: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 166: That is an easy thing for a person to say.
Sentence 167: The first 5 years have been rather difficult, but the country is still on its feet.
Sentence 168: And in spite of some unemployment, we have more people at work than ever before in the history of any country in the history of the world.
Sentence 169: We have the most prosperous business setup that the country has ever seen, if the Wall Street reports are to be believed.
Sentence 170: We have the farmer in better financial condition than he has ever been in the history of the country, except at the top point in 1948, I think it was.
Sentence 171: And I can't see that there is any serious thing the matter with the country as a whole.
Sentence 172: I think it's in fine shape.
Sentence 173: In fact, the first 5 years after the greatest war in history have been easier on the United States than the aftermath of any other war that was ever fought in this country, if you will read your history a little carefully.
Sentence 174: Of course, it couldn't possibly be that the Executive is to be credited with that situation.
Sentence 175: That just took place.
Sentence 176: It would have taken place if we had had a moron on the job, according to the way the general attitude of some of the press is.
Sentence 177: [Laughter]
But I think that the President can take credit for the situation, and that is what he proposes to do.
Sentence 178: [More laughter]
Q. Next month sometime, Mr. President?
Sentence 179: [18.]
Sentence 180: Q. Mr. President, I notice you say the farmers are in the best condition, but how about the rest of us, with the surpluses and the high food prices?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 181: I think that you get plenty to eat, Miss May,
3
and I have an idea that you are getting a bigger salary than you ever have gotten before in your life.
Sentence 182: 3 Mrs. May Craig of the Portland (Maine) Press Herald.
Sentence 183: Q.
Sentence 184: Yes sir, but they don't get as much as I do.
Sentence 185: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 186: That's true, but they are getting more than they ever got before in their history.
Sentence 187: Q.
Sentence 188: But there are still surpluses to be destroyed.
Sentence 189: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 190: If you will study the situation, you will find that the principle of surpluses being destroyed was brought about by your representative in the Senate from Maine, and it was potatoes that caused most of the trouble.
Sentence 191: Q. Butter, eggs, wheat, corn, cotton--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 192: Yes, the output of every farmer is at its greatest and farmers are prosperous, and we have a solution for that, a proposition which has been in the Congress ever since the 1st day of January of this year to meet that problem.
Sentence 193: We have the solution for it.
Sentence 194: If you will work for that solution as hard as you are bringing attention to the surpluses, we will get it solved.
Sentence 195: Q. Is that the Brannan plan?
Sentence 196: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 197: That is the Brannan plan.
Sentence 198: 4
[19.]
Sentence 199: Q. Mr. President, getting back to your answer a minute ago where you covered the domestic situation, I was just wondering if you feel that the problems of peace are any more difficult now--
Sentence 200: I mean in the last 20 months than they were?
Sentence 201: This is a perennial question, and I know you commented on it before.
Sentence 202: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 203: I think the situation worldwide is better than it was in 1946, and I think there has been a gradual improvement.
Sentence 204: 4 On April 7, 1949, Secretary of Agriculture Charles F. Brannan appeared at a joint session of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, at which time he outlined his price support plan.
Sentence 205: The plan would substitute an income support standard for the previous parity formula, use direct payments to farmers when prices of certain perishables fell too far below parity, and let those perishables sell to consumers at supply and demand prices.
Sentence 206: [20.]
Sentence 207: Q. Mr. President, do you plan to campaign for the Brannan plan when you go to Wisconsin in May?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 208: What's that?
Sentence 209: Q. Do you plan to speak for the Brannan plan when you go to Wisconsin in May?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 210: I am going on a nonpolitical tour to dedicate some dams, and I think my speeches will not be partisan or political.
Sentence 211: The one in Chicago may be, but that will be at the end of the trip.
Sentence 212: Q. Will you "dam" the Republicans a little bit in Chicago?
Sentence 213: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 214: I beg your pardon?
Sentence 215: Q. Will you "dam" the Republicans a little bit in Chicago ?
Sentence 216: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 217: Well, you had better wait and see.
Sentence 218: I don't like to prophesy what I am going to say.
Sentence 219: I think you found that out on the train.
Sentence 220: [21.]
Sentence 221: Q. Mr. President, if you plan to sign the new housing bill, can you give us some idea of how soon that action might come ?
Sentence 222: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 223: The bill has not come to my desk yet.
Sentence 224: It is being analyzed by the various departments.
Sentence 225: When it comes to my desk, why I will let you know about it.
Sentence 226: 5

On April 20, 1950, the President signed the Housing Act of 1950 (64 Stat. 48).
Sentence 227: [22.]
Sentence 228: Q. How about the Kerr bill, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 229: The Kerr bill is under consideration now.
Sentence 230: It is being analyzed in the various departments.
Sentence 231: [23.]
Sentence 232: Q. Mr. President, is there any light you can shed on the disappearance of the Navy Privateer over the Baltic?
Sentence 233: 6
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 234: There is an investigation, and it has been ordered by Admiral Conolly,
7
and I can make no comment on it until we know all the facts.
Sentence 235: 6 On April 8, 1950, a United States Navy patrol plane vanished over the Baltic Sea.
Sentence 236: The plane, carrying four officers and six enlisted men, was a Privateer, a four-engined plane with a tail assembly somewhat resembling that of the B-29.
Sentence 237: U.S. officials stated that the plane left Wiesbaden Air Base in Germany and that its destination was Copenhagen, Denmark.
Sentence 238: Some debris was later sighted by search planes, but there were no survivors.
Sentence 239: The Soviet Government subsequently stated that Russian planes had fired upon a B-29 Flying Fortress after it had failed to comply with orders and had opened fire upon the Soviet planes.
Sentence 240: 7
Rear Adm. Richard L. Conolly, commander of the U.S. fleet in the Mediterranean and east Atlantic.
Sentence 241: [24.]
Sentence 242: Q. Mr. President, have you received a series of gifts and telegrams from son April 20, 1950, the President signed the Housing Act of 1950 (64 Stat. 48).
Sentence 243: Congressman Heselton of Massachusetts?
8
Any comment on that, sir?
Sentence 244: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 245: No comment.
Sentence 246: 8
Sentence 247: The White House had been receiving a large number of telegrams from Representative John W. Heselton of Massachusetts expressing his views on agriculture and the surplus food situation.
Sentence 248: The gifts that he had forwarded to the President were small boxes of rice, dried peas, dried milk, shelled peanuts, potatoes, and similar farm products.
Sentence 249: Q.
Sentence 250: What do you do with them?
Sentence 251: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 252: What do I do with them?
Sentence 253: There's a nice, round file under my desk.
Sentence 254: [Laughter]
Sentence 255: [25.]
Sentence 256: Q. Mr. President, your old friend Dr. Gallup says that right now your popularity is not what it might be.
Sentence 257: Do you think that you might do something about that on this trip?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 258: Will you turn back to about March 1948, and read Mr. Gallup?
Sentence 259: Q.
Sentence 260: Yes sir, I know that.
Sentence 261: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 262: Well, that's about on the same par with that.
Sentence 263: [26.]
Sentence 264: Q. Mr. President, will you make any talks in Ohio on your way to or from Chicago?
Sentence 265: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 266: I can't answer that question, because the details of the trip have not been outlined as yet.
Sentence 267: Grand Coulee and Chicago are the only definite dates.
Sentence 268: [27.]
Sentence 269: Q. Mr. President, you said the international situation is better now than it was in 1946?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 270: Yes, it is.
Sentence 271: Q. Have you a reason for choosing 1946 rather than 1945?
Sentence 272: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 273: I think 1946 was about the worst time that we had anywhere.
Sentence 274: It was shortly after 1946 that we instituted the program for Greece and Turkey, and the Marshall plan came in June 1947.
Sentence 275: That was about the worst time with which we were faced that I can remember, except by a shooting war itself.
Sentence 276: [28.]
Sentence 277: Q. Mr. President, going back to those nonpartisan, nonpolitical speeches, do you consider the Brannan plan a partisan and political issue ?
Sentence 278: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 279: No, it is not a partisan, political issue.
Sentence 280: It is for the benefit of all the farmers of the United States.
Sentence 281: Q.
Sentence 282: Well then, Mr. President, you are not--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 283: And there are lots of Republican farmers that haven't been properly educated yet, or they would be Democrats.
Sentence 284: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, we didn't hear that last
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 285: Wait--you didn't give me a chance--you didn't give me a chance to finish my answer to your question.
Sentence 286: If you will give me a chance to answer your question, I will be glad to do it.
Sentence 287: I said the Brannan plan was not a partisan program, it is for the benefit of all the farmers of the United States, and there are lots of Republican farmers, I think, that if they had been properly educated they wouldn't be Republicans.
Sentence 288: What is the rest of your question now?
Sentence 289: Q.
Sentence 290: Well then, with that thought, you are not barred from speaking
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 291: I am not barred from speaking on anything I want
Sentence 292: to--[Laughter]--but I don't intend to make any what you might call partisan speeches on this trip.
Sentence 293: Q. Mr. President, does that still look like five or six major speeches?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 294: Oh, I can't answer you, because there are only--well, as I told you awhile ago, there are three stops in Wyoming to dedicate another dam--visit another dam.
Sentence 295: And I can't tell you how many speeches it will be.
Sentence 296: It will depend on how many stops we have.
Sentence 297: Q. A speech at every stop, sir?
Sentence 298: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 299: There may be 50 or 60 before we get through.
Sentence 300: [Laughter]
Q. We'll bring the oxygen tent with us.
Sentence 301: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 302: You had better bring the oxygen tent.
Sentence 303: [Laughter]
Reporter:
Sentence 304: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 305: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 306: You're welcome.
