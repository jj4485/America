Sentence 1: 1931 The Presidents News Conference 903

FEDERAL FARM BOARD
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have to announce to you something that I think you all know, and that is Mr.
Sentence 3: [Alexander] Legge's resignation.
Sentence 4: And I know that I reflect the view of the agricultural community when I express intense regret that his private affairs have made it necessary for him to leave the Board.
Sentence 5: He has been urged I think by every farm organization in the United States to continue as Chairman of the Farm Board, and I have urged him with all the pressures that I could bring to bear, but he feels obligations elsewhere.
Sentence 6: I have appointed Mr. James C. Stone as the Chairman of the Board, and Mr. [Charles C.] Teague has been elected Vice Chairman.
Sentence 7: We, therefore, have a vacancy on the Board which will require some 2 or 3 weeks to fill.
Sentence 8: RICHARD N. ELLIOTT
I have given an interim appointment to Congressman Elliott as Assistant Comptroller General.
Sentence 9: And that is all the news I have got today.
Sentence 10: ALEXANDER LEGGE
Q. Mr. President, does that resignation take effect immediately ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 11: Yes.
