Sentence 1: 1929 The Presidents News Conference 840

CONFERENCE WITH INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I am sorry that I haven't anything of any great consequence at this moment.
Sentence 3: Just for your own information, the problem that we have been at work on for the last few days is largely a question of work in each industry.
Sentence 4: The railway people, as you know, are meeting today in Chicago.
Sentence 5: The three different groups of public utilities--that is, the electrical power people and the street railway people and the gas people are meeting on Tuesday to see what construction programs they can definitely assure for next year.
Sentence 6: Q. Is that in New York ?
Sentence 7: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 8: I think it is--yes.
Sentence 9: And then other industries will be taken up.
Sentence 10: We have, as you saw yesterday, in the Chamber of Commerce at least, laid the foundation for a sort of an executive committee amongst the industries to follow up and organize each one of them in turn, and further than that we haven't gotten at the moment.
Sentence 11: We probably will hear something from the railway people in the course of today or tomorrow.
Sentence 12: The construction industries that we are having some discussion with this afternoon are largely on the question of information.
Sentence 13: They are the people who do the work, but do not produce the construction, so there is nothing of great national importance.
Sentence 14: It is largely a question of information from our point of view as to what the situation actually is in different segments of the industry.
Sentence 15: So far as they themselves are concerned, they are merely service organizations, so there will be nothing very startling out of that conference.
Sentence 16: Other than that, I haven't anything.
