2
See Item 254.
Sentence 47: Q. Mr. President, would you sign a substitute that is being sponsored by Mr. Kilgore?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 48: I can't answer that question because that bill has not been passed through either House of Congress, and it is not before me for consideration.
Sentence 49: I am not in a position to comment on legislation until it is a little further along than that bill is.
Sentence 50: That bill is an improvement over the Mundt-Nixon bill.
Sentence 51: Q. Mr. President, just to clarify one point, you said you would do the same thing to this McCarran bill as you would to the Mundt-Nixon bill, but you didn't say what you would do to the Mundt-Nixon bill?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: I made a statement on that last year, when Mr. Dewey and Mr. Stassen had their argument out in Oregon about the same time, that I wouldn't sign any such bill.

Thomas, president of the Monsanto Chemical Co., is quoted as saying that policy can be decided on only by the President himself.
Sentence 81: Is that a matter for Executive decision, or is it not a matter for legislation?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 82: Is that about the Science Foundation?
Sentence 83: Q.
Sentence 84: It's about the deferment of scientists and college students who are majoring in scientific subjects.
Sentence 85: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 86: I really don't understand the thing.
Sentence 87: There is a Science Foundation, which I have been trying to get an appropriation to implement, in which a board of scientists has been appointed by the President with an executive director, and it is their business, I think, to try and arrange for the education of young men for a scientific career.
Sentence 88: I think that the President makes the appointments, and the board itself will pass on the students and how they are to be educated.
Sentence 89: Q.
Sentence 90: This apparently was concerned with the drafting of scientists.
Sentence 91: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: That is a matter that will have to be worked out on a commonsense basis, just like all the rest of the things we are faced with, and we will try to do it that way.

Sentence 106: It is not proper for me to discuss it before they have their meeting.
Sentence 107: [10.]
Sentence 108: Q. Do you have anything to say about the attack on Oscar Chapman's patriotism?
Sentence 109: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 110: Mr. Chapman is up before the committee now, and then when he gets through, that attack will be exploded into little bits, just like former attacks of the same kind have been.
Sentence 111: 8

Sentence 123: It was a United Nations plane that did the shooting down.
Sentence 124: [13.]
Sentence 125: Q. Mr. President, this question was not asked you.
Sentence 126: Do you have under consideration the creation of an economic stabilization agency, which would have control over wages and prices and other matters?
Sentence 127: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 140: [15.]
Sentence 141: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us-this may be a little bit in answer to your speech Saturday night--can you tell us whether you feel now that it is necessary to control prices rather widely, or on a selective basis, or as yet not at all?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 142: Well now, I have to analyze the bill and find out just exactly what it provides before I can answer that question.
Sentence 143: I will answer it categorically when I have all the information before me.
Sentence 144: [16.]
Sentence 145: Q. Mr. President, I think that there are a lot of people who have the idea that we have been pushed back from our lines in Korea in the last few days.
Sentence 146: Do you not have that idea, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 147: There are certain points in the line that have been crashed, but those points are being pushed back to their former grounds, and I think that will happen before the week is out.
Sentence 148: At least, that is my opinion.
Sentence 149: I am not a desk strategist and don't pretend to be one.
Sentence 150: I leave that to the military men.
Sentence 151: [17.]
Sentence 152: Q. Mr. President, last night you commented about the Spanish loan that Congress has put in the appropriation bill.
Sentence 153: Could you clarify that, sir, as to whether the Spanish are now limited to going to the Export-Import Bank, or is there some chance that they might get this under certain limited conditions?

Sentence 161: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 162: The official reports are always a few days behind on the casualties, because they try to notify the nearest of kin before they have the lists published.
Sentence 163: The total casualties are reported to me every day.
