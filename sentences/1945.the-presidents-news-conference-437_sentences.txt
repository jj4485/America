Sentence 2: The Presidents News Conference 437

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 3: Well, I've got a telegram I will read to you.
Sentence 4: Is everybody in?
Sentence 5: Mr. Early: Yes, sir.
Sentence 6: [1.]
Sentence 7: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 8: This is dated Miami, Florida, April 19, addressed to me here.
Sentence 9: "Dear Mr. President: Some time ago, you made an appeal--
Voices: Little slower--slow!
Sentence 10: Mr. Early: You will get copies of it later.
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 12: I will read it to you first.
Sentence 13: Then I will see that you get copies.
Sentence 14: [Reading, not literally] "Dear Mr. President: Some time ago you made an appeal to me which I think I responded to at the moment in good spirit.
Sentence 15: Now I am going to make an appeal to you.
Sentence 16: Please let us have Leonard Reinsch back.
Sentence 17: When we gave our consent we were not sufficiently mindful of the tremendous tasks ahead of us in radio in connection with Television, Frequency Modulation and what not.
Sentence 18: On special occasions for your personal uses his services could be availed of without embarrassment to us.
Sentence 19: It might not seem a patriotic impulse which prompts this message, and yet I am sure on reflection you will see it is justified.
Sentence 20: Kindest regards, James M. Cox."
Sentence 21: And he is my friend.
Sentence 22: I think he will do anything in the world for me, so as to make Leonard available to me for the radio jobs that he has always done.
Sentence 23: Leonard will be on call just as Jimmy Byrnes is for anything that I want.
Sentence 24: And I am going to comply with Governor Cox's request.
Sentence 25: [2.]
Sentence 26: And the reason I am calling you in to give this to you is because I called in Charlie Ross last night after this happened, and Charlie agreed to come with me after this San Francisco Conference, on May 15th.
Sentence 27: Then Charlie and I got sentimental, and called up our old schoolteacher in Independence last night, and I am afraid that there is a leak in Independence--[laughter]--and Charlie also called up his son.
Sentence 28: I didn't want you fellows to be scooped on it, so that's why I am doing this.
Sentence 29: Q. Did you say he called his old schoolteacher--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 30: He and I called her together.
Sentence 31: She is the only schoolteacher that is living, and so we called her up.
Sentence 32: We used to go to school together.
Sentence 33: I asked Mr. Pulitzer to give Charlie 2 years' leave, and Mr. Pulitzer very kindly complied with that; and I hope he won't do the same to me that has happened here.
Sentence 34: I hope not.
Sentence 35: He said he wouldn't.
Sentence 36: Q.
Sentence 37: What is the schoolteacher's name?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: Miss Tilly Brown.
Sentence 39: Matilda Brown.
Sentence 40: We always called her Tilly.
Sentence 41: Matilda--M-a-t-i-l-d-a--Brown.
Sentence 42: We always called her Tilly.
Sentence 43: Q.
Sentence 44: That is at Independence?
Sentence 45: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 46: At Independence.
Sentence 47: Q. How old is she, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 48: Well, I don't think she would object to her age being
Sentence 49: told--[laughter]--but I don't know.
Sentence 50: She is somewhere between 75 and 80.
Sentence 51: Q. Was that grade school?
Sentence 52: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: High school.
Sentence 54: She taught Charlie and me English.
Sentence 55: Q. Were you in the same class?
Sentence 56: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 57: Charlie and I graduated in the same high school class.
Sentence 58: Q.
Sentence 59: What was that year, sir ?
Sentence 60: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 61: 1901.
Sentence 62: Do your own figuring.
Sentence 63: [Laughter] That covers everything, doesn't it?
Sentence 64: [3.]
Sentence 65: Oh, yes.
Sentence 66: I almost forgot something.
Sentence 67: Jonathan [Daniels] has agreed to stay with me.
Sentence 68: He is going to stay with me until Charlie comes.
Sentence 69: Does that take care of everything?
Sentence 70: I am appreciative of that, too, just as I am of all these things; and I am exceedingly happy to have these people on call when I need them.
Sentence 71: Q.
Sentence 72: When are you--when is Mr. Reinsch leaving?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 73: At his convenience.
Sentence 74: The telegram is specific.
Sentence 75: Q. Mr. Ross will come in about the 15th of May, sir?
Sentence 76: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 77: Yes.
Sentence 78: [4.]
Sentence 79: Q. Mr. President, what about the reports that Leslie Biffke will come down here?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 80: They have no foundation in fact.
Sentence 81: Q. Mr. President,--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 82: Les is literally of much more use to me as Secretary to the Senate than he would be down here at the White House--much more use to the Senate.
Sentence 83: I don't want to cripple the Senate by taking Les Biffle away from them.
Sentence 84: What did you start to say?
Sentence 85: Q. I started to say, sir, that means that you didn't even ask for him to come down.
Sentence 86: The report is going around that you and Mr. Barkley were arguing over who was going to get Les.
Sentence 87: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 88: Oh, that is--no argument--[inaudible words]--only in fun.
Sentence 89: Don't quote that, though.
Sentence 90: There was never any thought on my part that Biffle be brought down here.
Sentence 91: Q. Nothing serious?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: No. I wouldn't say there was no kidding--[inaudible words]--Barkley, you know, and I like to rib each other.
Sentence 93: I was worrying him a little bit, and he was trying to worry me.
Sentence 94: Q.
Sentence 95: You'd say he was a good man in almost any job he worked ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: Biffle?
Sentence 97: They don't make them any better than Biffle.
Sentence 98: And you can quote me on that.
Sentence 99: Q. Mr. Ross will be the Press Secretary?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: Press Secretary.
Sentence 101: Reporter:
Sentence 102: Thank you, sir.
