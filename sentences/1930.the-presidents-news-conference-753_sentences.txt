Sentence 1: 1930 The Presidents News Conference 753

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I think I have done my share on print for tomorrow morning already.
Sentence 3: DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE LONDON NAVAL TREATY
There are just one or two matters in the background of this question of documentation to the Senate solely for your own information.
Sentence 4: There seems to be some misunderstanding as to the character of the documentation.
Sentence 5: It consists mostly of opinions of not only our own officials in different capacities but the opinions which they have secured from other officials of foreign governments on these problems--often enough their views on the attitudes of officials in other governments and views as to public opinion and public questions in connection with treaties of this kind.
Sentence 6: It represents a lot of material which may be reliable and some of it unreliable.
Sentence 7: It also includes a lot of tentative suggestions that came up from different quarters of the world as to methods of handling specific problems, some of which are serious and some of which are not.
Sentence 8: All of it involves somebody's name and somebody's position, and a great many of them officials of other governments, as well as our own.
Sentence 9: And there is no explosive material from General Dawes, as has been commonly rumored--nothing of that character in it.
Sentence 10: SHIPPING ADVISORY BOARD
I have one other question, as to the new Advisory Board in shipping questions.
Sentence 11: The Board assembled this morning, and the Shipping Board has provided them with offices and arranged for full cooperation with them, and I am in hopes they will get ahead rapidly with their work.
Sentence 12: Otherwise, I think I have made enough contribution from the White House for today.
