THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I signed an important bill this morning, and it is usual to give the pen to those who contributed most to the passage, so I am going to make Joe Fox a present of the pillar bill pen--[laughter].

has turned columnist.
Sentence 17: He starts off by complaining that the reporters don't get sleep enough on their trips with me.
Sentence 18: Quite an interesting article, in some out-of-town papers.
Sentence 19: I don't think Tony knew I was going to get hold of that.
Sentence 20: [Laughter] I will try to give you a real merry-go-round next time.
Sentence 21: We really haven't had a strenuous trip yet, Tony.
Sentence 22: [More laughter]
2 Ernest B. Vaccaro of the Associated Press.
Sentence 23: Q. Mr. President, you are not solely responsible for that loss of sleep, are you, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 24: NO sir.
Sentence 25: No sir, I get plenty.
Sentence 26: I didn't know why Tony didn't.
Sentence 27: Q.
Sentence 28: Can we have that in quotes, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 29: Better not.
Sentence 30: That might embarrass Tony at home.
Sentence 31: [Laughter]
Q. Do you think there will be any trips in 1948, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 32: Well, I imagine that there will be.
Sentence 33: Be a trip home, at any rate.
Sentence 34: Q. Lot of prophecy there, isn't it, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 35: Whether you want to hire a plane on that occasion and follow me or not remains to be seen.
Sentence 36: Q.
Sentence 37: That would be 1949, wouldn't it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: Well, we will discuss that when it comes up.
Sentence 39: I never want to discuss it or think about it.
Sentence 40: Now I am ready for questions, if you have any you think I can answer.
Sentence 41: [3.]
Sentence 42: Q. Mr. President, do you believe some further labor legislation, in addition to the portal act, should be enacted this session?
Sentence 43: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: I expressed my views on that in the message I sent to the Congress on the State of the Union.
Sentence 45: Q.
Sentence 46: Do you stand on what you said then?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: I do.
Sentence 48: [4.]
Sentence 49: Q. Mr. President, French papers claim that you are going to send a new Ambassador to France?

Sentence 52: Maybe they know my mind better than I do.
Sentence 53: [5.]
Sentence 54: Q. Mr. President, do you intend to keep Mr. Messersmith in the Argentine indefinitely?
Sentence 55: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 56: When Mr. Messersmith went to the Argentine, he made it a condition of his going that he was only going temporarily, but I don't know when that time will end.
Sentence 57: That is a matter that we will have to work out at the proper time.
Sentence 58: Mr. Messersmith has not been in good health, and he explained to me that when he was down there he was doing it as a favor to Mr. Byrnes and myself.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 61: NO, I can't.
Sentence 62: Q.
Sentence 63: When will that appointment be made, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: Just as quickly as I can get the man I am interested in to take the job.
Sentence 65: Q. Have you got such a man in mind?
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: Yes, I have.
Sentence 68: Q. Is he reluctant to take the job, sir?
Sentence 69: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: Yes sir.
Sentence 71: People are always reluctant to take a hard job.
Sentence 72: There's a difference, you know, between doing a patriotic duty in peacetime and doing a patriotic duty when the country is in a shooting war, when there is some sort of incentive that makes people more cooperative, more anxious to make sacrifices--and I can't blame them.
Sentence 73: But the present period is just as important for the welfare of the country as actual shooting warfare would be.
Sentence 74: And I hope the patriots will bear that in mind: it is necessary to do things that you don't want to do-some good--for the welfare and benefit of your country.
Sentence 75: I didn't intend to give you a lecture.

Sentence 85: [9.]
Sentence 86: Q. Mr. President, have you ever lifted that freeze order on reclamation of funds that went out about January 10?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: No, I have not.
Sentence 88: That freeze order was worked out on the basis of what we thought the Interior Department could spend, and I think you can get--I know you can get all the details in regard to it from the Budget.
Sentence 89: It is a complicated proposition, and I would advise you to talk to the Budget about it.
Sentence 90: [10.]

Sentence 99: [12.]
Sentence 100: Q. Mr. President, has Chester Bowles's group presented a price reduction plan to you?

Sentence 115: [15.]
Sentence 116: Q. Mr. President, returning to Mr. Messersmith, would it be correct to say that Mr. Messersmith will return to this country when he has completed his mission ?
Sentence 117: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 118: Yes, that is perfectly correct.
Sentence 119: Q. Would that go for Mr. Caffery too, Mr. President ?
Sentence 120: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 121: I have no comment on that.
Sentence 122: Mr. Caffery is not on the same sort of mission that Mr. Messersmith is.
Sentence 123: [16.]

Sentence 137: [19.]

Sentence 141: [20.]
Sentence 142: Q. Mr. President, will you comment on a report published in Manila newspapers, that you would name Emmet O'Neal Ambassador to the Philippines this week?

Sentence 154: Q. Mr. President, the subject of displaced persons is coming up again, it seems to be becoming more acute.
Sentence 155: I thought last year you urged admission of more people up to the limit of the laws-
THE PRESIDENT, That is true.
Sentence 156: Q.
Sentence 157: and I wondered if you had any rough estimate of how many you thought we might be able to absorb now?
Sentence 158: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 159: I have no estimate on the subject.
Sentence 160: I went into it in some detail at that time, and instructions have been given to the State Department.
Sentence 161: For myself, I have suggested using the unused quota of northern Europe for displaced persons.
Sentence 162: They have been working on that.
Sentence 163: The results have not been very satisfactory.
Sentence 164: [23.]
Sentence 165: Q. Mr. President, with regard to Mr. Bowles's belief--that other people have and that you do not have yet, sir--do you think there is going to be a bust in 3 to 5 months?
Sentence 166: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: I think I have told you time and again that I do not believe so.
Sentence 168: I think I made that statement categorically to you at least half-a-dozen times.
Sentence 169: [24.]
Sentence 170: Q. Returning to the question of displaced persons for a moment, there is a bill in Congress which would admit, I think, 400,000 persons in the next 4 years.
Sentence 171: Do you have any plan to send a message to Congress on the general question of admission?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 172: Not at the present time.
Sentence 173: Doing everything we possibly can to get the displaced persons situation worked out.

Sentence 184: Q. Mr. President, I would like to know--
[26.]
Sentence 185: Q. Mr. President, has the GREEK TURKISH bill come down to you yet?
Sentence 186: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 187: No, it has not.
Sentence 188: What was your question?
Sentence 189: [27.]
Sentence 190: Q. On this question of "bust," you said you don't think that it will be in 5 months--I mean, what is your affirmative attitude on the economic outlook for the future?
Sentence 191: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 192: I don't think there is any necessity for ever having a bust.
Sentence 193: If we use good sense and follow just common--the rules of commonsense, don't let the greedy people get control of the country, we won't have any bust.
Sentence 194: We shouldn't have any boom.
Sentence 195: That is what we have been trying to prevent.
Sentence 196: Would like to keep a ceiling on prices, and things of that sort, so there wouldn't be any boom or bust.
Sentence 197: We have had not much cooperation either legislatively or publicly on that, except that there are a large number of people who have made every effort they can to cooperate with us in this price situation.
Sentence 198: Q. Mr. President, do you think this pending tax bill would accentuate the boom?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 199: I can't answer that because I don't know what's in it.
Sentence 200: I will tell you that when it comes up here.
Sentence 201: Q. Mr. President, you had an "if" in your statement, that if we use commonsense, and it gave me the impression that you might think we are a trifle off the beam somewhere.
Sentence 202: Could you indicate that?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 203: Well, I think prices are too high, particularly commodity prices.
Sentence 204: Q. Is that the main--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 205: That is the main ill.
Sentence 206: [28.]
Sentence 207: Q. Mr. President, are you hopeful that the cuts made by the House Appropriations Committee in western reclamational and power projects will be restored by the Congress--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 208: My Budget Message covered that situation completely.
Sentence 209: I set down in the budget exactly what I thought should be done, and I am sticking by that budget.
Sentence 210: Reporter:
Sentence 211: Thank you, Mr. President.
