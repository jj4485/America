Sentence 164: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, the Republicans said at their National Committee meeting that they would not cooperate if you sent up a radical message.
Sentence 165: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 166: Well now, who is to define that?
Sentence 167: Who is to say whether it's radical ?
Sentence 168: I shall send up a message on what I believe to be necessary for the welfare of the United States, and that will be my viewpoint.
