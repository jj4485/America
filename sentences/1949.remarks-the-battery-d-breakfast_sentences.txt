Sentence 1: 1949 Remarks The Battery D Breakfast

I WANT to tell you how very much I appreciate your coming.
Sentence 2: I consider it a great personal tribute to me, not as President of the United States, but as your former Battery Commander.
Sentence 3: You have a place of honor in the parade, and I am satisfied that although some of you may have rubber tires around here, you can make that mile and a quarter at 120-to-the-minute without any trouble.
Sentence 4: [At this point the President was presented with a walking stick.
Sentence 5: He then resumed speaking.]
Sentence 6: Well, that is wonderful!
Sentence 7: That is the symbol of our Battery, which is marked D-129.
Sentence 8: That is a beautiful walking stick.
Sentence 9: I use one every morning.
Sentence 10: I was intending to walk up here this morning, but I was afraid to wear out the newspaper correspondents, so I came in the car.
Sentence 11: But I appreciate that most highly.
Sentence 12: It is something I can use, something that is worthwhile, and something that my daughter can perhaps some day give to my grandson.
Sentence 13: I want again to thank you, and tell you how much I appreciate this honor you have paid me.
