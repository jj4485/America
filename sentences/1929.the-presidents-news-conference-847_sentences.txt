Sentence 1: 1929 The Presidents News Conference 847

COMMISSION TO ATTEND CEREMONIES IN ICELAND
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have very little of general public interest at this time.
Sentence 3: Some of the special public will be interested in the appointment of the commission to attend the celebration of the 1,000th anniversary of the Althing in Iceland, and I have requested Senator [Peter] Norbeck, Congressman
Sentence 4: [O.B.] Burtness, Mr. [Frederick H.] Fljozdal, Mr. [O.P.B.] Jacobson, and Mr. [Sveinbjorn] Johnson to become members of that commission, all of which you will find set out in a mimeographed sheet.
Sentence 5: APPOINTMENT OF G. AARON YOUNGQUIST
I have to announce today the appointment of Mr. Youngquist to the Department of Justice, and I only wanted to say that we have had some delay in that appointment because of the unwillingness of Mr. Youngquist to come for some considerable time.
Sentence 6: It has taken a certain amount of persuasion to induce him to leave his present position to come into the Federal Government, which accounts for most of our delay in filling the position.
Sentence 7: I am glad he has been able finally to accept.
Sentence 8: Other than that I have no startling news.
