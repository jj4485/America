THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I have some things to talk to you about today.

Sentence 5: You will have to make your notes.
Sentence 6: [To Mr. Ross] This one isn't?
Sentence 7: Mr. Ross: But it is printed.

headed by Mr. Charles Luckman, and I wish again to thank the Committee for its effective work in the emergency phases of our food conservation program.
Sentence 12: The report will be released for publication shortly.
Sentence 13: I think you will find it extremely interesting.
Sentence 14: 1
The 83-page report is dated December 18, 1947.
Sentence 15: "I wish to call your attention particularly to the statement about the number of men thrown out of work by the temporary shutdown of the distilleries.
Sentence 16: I believe you will find a good story there.
Sentence 17: "You will recall the estimates that fifty to one hundred thousand employees would be thrown out of jobs.
Sentence 18: Later it appeared that a maximum of some three thousand might be affected.
Sentence 19: The report now shows that 965 workers were actually laid off because of that shutdown, and that the United States Employment Service was able to place 551 of these in new jobs.
Sentence 20: The result is that only 414 of the distillery workers are now out of work--414 as contrasted with the hysterical estimate of more than fifty thousand"--as are most of these estimates.
Sentence 21: [2.]
Sentence 22: The Honorable David A. Reed resigned from the Battle Monuments Commission, and I have today appointed Adm. Edward C. Kalbfus of the Naval School at Newport, R.I.

Sentence 25: Their function is to "advise in the avoidance of industrial controversies and the manner in which mediation and voluntary adjustments shall be administered, particularly with reference to controversies affecting the general welfare of the country."
Sentence 26: And this list will be available, along with a short statement in regard to it, as you go out.

Sentence 35: And I have a short statement with reference to Mr. Anderson's appearance before the congressional committee.
Sentence 36: [Reading, not literally] "With reference to the question regarding the publication of the list of speculators in commodity markets, I think that such list should be made public.
Sentence 37: "However, the Congress has provided by law that information furnished to the agencies of the Government on a confidential basis shall not be divulged.
Sentence 38: Since the Congress itself has so provided, it is necessary that the Congress take some action removing this restriction.
Sentence 39: The Secretary of Agriculture could then make the list public.
Sentence 40: "A resolution giving such authority to the Secretary of Agriculture has already been introduced and could quickly be adopted.
Sentence 41: "I would approve such a resolution immediately.
Sentence 42: 1
"At the hearing this morning before the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Secretary further stated that he would furnish the list to the committee, if so directed, provided the meeting was held in public and the list was made available to the public.
Sentence 43: The committee refused to take this course of action.
Sentence 44: Instead, the committee adopted a resolution that the list should be furnished to it at a secret session and behind closed doors.
Sentence 45: 1
On December 19, 1947, the President approved a joint resolution authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to publish the names of persons transacting business on the boards of trade and to furnish such names to committees of Congress upon request (61 Stat. 941).
Sentence 46: "The Secretary properly rejected this proposal.
Sentence 47: "I fully support the position of the Secretary of Agriculture.
Sentence 48: "I have already made my position clear with reference to speculation on the commodity exchanges, and I hope that the Congress will act promptly so that the facts in
this situation can be known to all."

Q. Is that statement mimeographed, sir?

Sentence 58: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 59: I would be most happy to see General Stalin in Washington, if he wants to come here.
Sentence 60: I have said that time and again.
Sentence 61: But I want to say to you, and clear you up entirely, that the meeting at Yalta and at Potsdam was of the heads of the states and not the foreign ministers.
Sentence 62: The foreign ministers conference was organized at Potsdam, so the foreign ministers didn't have anything to fall out about at those meetings.

Sentence 65: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: That was only preliminary.

Sentence 94: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 95: I think that has been very well commented on by Senator Morse.
Sentence 96: [Laughter]
Sentence 97: [9.]
Sentence 98: Q. Mr. President, if there is a budget surplus of $7 billion in the Treasury, as reported, do you think that would justify tax reduction ?
Sentence 99: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: I do not.
Sentence 101: Q. Mr. President, does that mean you are against any tax reduction next year?
