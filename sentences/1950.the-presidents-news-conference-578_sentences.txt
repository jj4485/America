Sentence 132: I think I made the statement here the other day that I was perfectly willing to cooperate with the committee in furnishing them with information.
Sentence 133: We will cross the loyalty file business when we get to it.
Sentence 134: But just for your information, if people really were in earnest and had the welfare of the country at heart, and they really thought that somebody in the Government was not loyal or did not do his job right, the proper person with whom to take that up is the President of the United States.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 142: As affected by what?
Q. By the loyalty program.
Sentence 143: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 144: I think that the loyalty program was worked out with civil liberties in view.
Sentence 145: And I think if you will follow the procedure that was followed by the loyalty investigations, you will find that nobody's civil liberties have been infringed, and nobody's civil liberties will be infringed.
Sentence 146: I think I made that perfectly clear when I was talking to the district attorneys and the law enforcement officers who were here the other day.
Sentence 147: If you will read the speech,
5
I think you will get the fundamental basis on which I am trying to uphold the Bill of Rights.

THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 192: [17.]
