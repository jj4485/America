Sentence 1: 1936 Address Chautauqua Ny

As many of you who are here tonight know, I formed the excellent habit of coming to Chautauqua more than twenty years ago.
Sentence 2: After my Inauguration in 1933, I promised Mr. Bestor that during the next four years I would come to Chautauqua again.
Sentence 3: It is in fulfillment of this that I am with you tonight.
Sentence 4: A few days ago I was asked what the subject of this talk would be; and I replied that for two good reasons I wanted to discuss the subject of peace: First, because it is eminently appropriate in Chautauqua and, second, because in the hurly-burly of domestic politics it is important that our people should not overlook problems and issues which, though they lie beyond our borders, may, and probably will, have a vital influence on the United States of the future.
Sentence 5: Many who have visited me in Washington in the past few months may have been surprised when I have told them that personally and because of my own daily contacts with all manner of difficult situations I am more concerned and less cheerful about international world conditions than about our immediate domestic prospects.
Sentence 6: I say this to you not as a confirmed pessimist but as one who still hopes that envy, hatred and malice among Nations have reached their peak and will be succeeded by a new tide of peace and good-will.
Sentence 7: I say this as one who has participated in many of the decisions of peace and war before, during and after the World War; one who has traveled much; and one who has spent a goodly portion of every twenty-four hours in the study of foreign relations.
Sentence 8: Long before I returned to Washington as President of the United States, I had made up my mind that pending what might be called a more opportune moment on other continents, the United States could best serve the cause of a peaceful humanity by setting an example.
Sentence 9: That was why on the 4th of March, 1933, I made the following declaration:
Sentence 10: "In the field of world policy I would dedicate this Nation to the policy of the good neighbor- the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others—the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors.
Sentence 11: "
This declaration represents my purpose; but it represents more than a purpose, for it stands for a practice.
Sentence 12: To a measurable degree it has succeeded; the whole world now knows that the United States cherishes no predatory ambitions.
Sentence 13: We are strong; but less powerful Nations know that they need not fear our strength.
Sentence 14: We seek no conquest; we stand for peace.
Sentence 15: In the whole of the Western Hemisphere our good-neighbor policy has produced results that are especially heartening.
Sentence 16: The noblest monument to peace and to neighborly economic and social friendship in all the world is not a monument in bronze or stone, but the boundary which unites the United States and Canada—3,000 miles of friendship with no barbed wire, no gun or soldier, and no passport on the whole frontier.
Sentence 17: Mutual trust made that frontier.
Sentence 18: To extend the same sort of mutual trust throughout the Americas was our aim.
Sentence 19: The American Republics to the south of us have been ready always to cooperate with the United States on a basis of equality and mutual respect, but before we inaugurated the good-neighbor policy there were among them resentment and fear, because certain Administrations in Washington had slighted their national pride and their sovereign rights.
Sentence 20: In pursuance of the good-neighbor policy, and because in my younger days I had learned many lessons in the hard school of experience, I stated that the United States was opposed definitely to armed intervention.
Sentence 21: We have negotiated a Pan-American convention embodying the principle of non-intervention.
Sentence 22: We have abandoned the Platt Amendment which gave us the right to intervene in the internal affairs of the Republic of Cuba.
Sentence 23: We have withdrawn American marines from Haiti.
Sentence 24: We have signed a new treaty which places our relations with Panama on a mutually satisfactory basis.
Sentence 25: We have undertaken a series of trade agreements with other American countries to our mutual commercial profit.
Sentence 26: At the request of two neighboring Republics, I hope to give assistance in the final settlement of the last serious boundary dispute between any of the American Nations.
Sentence 27: Throughout the Americas the spirit of the good neighbor is a practical and living fact.
Sentence 28: The twenty-one American Republics are not only living together in friendship and in peace; they are united in the determination so to remain.
Sentence 29: To give substance to this determination a conference will meet on December 1, 1936, at the capital of our great Southern neighbor, Argentina, and it is, I know, the hope of all Chiefs of State of the Americas that this will result in measures which will banish wars forever from this vast portion of the earth.
Sentence 30: Peace, like charity, begins at home; that is why we have begun at home.
Sentence 31: But peace in the Western world is not all that we seek.
Sentence 32: It is our hope that knowledge of the practical application of the good-neighbor policy in this hemisphere will be borne home to our neighbors across the seas.
Sentence 33: For ourselves we are on good terms with them—terms in most cases of straightforward friendship, of peaceful understanding.
Sentence 34: But, of necessity, we are deeply concerned about tendencies of recent years among many of the Nations of other continents.
Sentence 35: It is a bitter experience to us when the spirit of agreements to which we are a party is not lived up to.
Sentence 36: It is an even more bitter experience for the whole company of Nations to witness not only the spirit but the letter of international agreements violated with impunity and without regard to the simple principles of honor.
Sentence 37: Permanent friendships between Nations as between men can be sustained only by scrupulous respect for the pledged word.
Sentence 38: In spite of all this we have sought steadfastly to assist international movements to prevent war.
Sentence 39: We cooperated to the bitter end—and it was a bitter end—in the work of the General Disarmament Conference.
Sentence 40: When it failed we sought a separate treaty to deal with the manufacture of arms and the international traffic in arms.
Sentence 41: That proposal also came to nothing.
Sentence 42: We participated—again to the bitter end—in a conference to continue naval limitations, and when it became evident that no general treaty could be signed because of the objections of other Nations, we concluded with Great Britain and France a conditional treaty of qualitative limitation which, much to my regret, already shows signs of ineffectiveness.
Sentence 43: We shun political commitments which might entangle us in foreign wars; we avoid connection with the political activities of the League of Nations; but I am glad to say that we have cooperated whole-heartedly in the social and humanitarian work at Geneva.
Sentence 44: Thus we are a part of the world effort to control traffic in narcotics, to improve international health, to help child welfare, to eliminate double taxation and to better working conditions and laboring hours throughout the world.
Sentence 45: We are not isolationists except in so far as we seek to isolate ourselves completely from war.
Sentence 46: Yet we must remember that so long as war exists on earth there will be some danger that even the Nation which most ardently desires peace may be drawn into war.
Sentence 47: I have seen war.
Sentence 48: I have seen war on land and sea.
Sentence 49: I have seen blood running from the wounded.
Sentence 50: I have seen men coughing out their gassed lungs.
Sentence 51: I have seen the dead in the mud.
Sentence 52: I have seen cities destroyed.
Sentence 53: I have seen two hundred limping, exhausted men come out of line—the survivors of a regiment of one thousand that went forward forty-eight hours before.
Sentence 54: I have seen children starving.
Sentence 55: I have seen the agony of mothers and wives.
Sentence 56: I hate war.
Sentence 57: I have passed unnumbered hours, I shall pass unnumbered hours, thinking and planning how war may be kept from this Nation.
Sentence 58: I wish I could keep war from all Nations; but that is beyond my power.
Sentence 59: I can at least make certain that no act of the United States helps to produce or to promote war.
Sentence 60: I can at least make clear that the conscience of America revolts against war and that any Nation which provokes war forfeits the sympathy of the people of the United States.
Sentence 61: Many causes produce war.
Sentence 62: There are ancient hatreds, turbulent frontiers, the "legacy of old forgotten, far-off things, and battles long ago."
Sentence 63: There are new-born fanaticisms, convictions on the part of certain peoples that they have become the unique depositories of ultimate truth and right.
Sentence 64: A dark old world was devastated by wars between conflicting religions.
Sentence 65: A dark modern world faces wars between conflicting economic and political fanaticisms in which are intertwined race hatreds.
Sentence 66: To bring it home, it is as if within the territorial limits of the United States, forty-eight Nations with forty-eight forms of government, forty-eight customs barriers, forty-eight languages, and forty-eight eternal and different verities, were spending their time and their substance in a frenzy of effort to make themselves strong enough to conquer their neighbors or strong enough to defend themselves against their neighbors.
Sentence 67: In one field, that of economic barriers, the American policy may be, I hope, of some assistance in discouraging the economic source of war and therefore a contribution toward the peace of the world.
Sentence 68: The trade agreements which we are making are not only finding outlets for the products of American fields and American factories but are also pointing the way to the elimination of embargoes, quotas and other devices which place such pressure on Nations not possessing great natural resources that to them the price of peace seems less terrible than the price of war.
Sentence 69: We do not maintain that a more liberal international trade will stop war; but we fear that without a more liberal international trade, war is a natural sequence.
Sentence 70: The Congress of the United States has given me certain authority to provide safeguards of American neutrality in case of war.
Sentence 71: The President of the United States, who, under our Constitution, is vested with primary authority to conduct our international relations, thus has been given new weapons with which to maintain our neutrality.
Sentence 72: Nevertheless and I speak from a long experience the effective maintenance of American neutrality depends today, as in the past, on the wisdom and determination of whoever at the moment occupy the offices of President and Secretary of State.
Sentence 73: It is clear that our present policy and the measures passed by the Congress would, in the event of a war on some other continent, reduce war profits which would otherwise accrue to American citizens.
Sentence 74: Industrial and agricultural production for a war market may give immense fortunes to a few men; for the Nation as a whole it produces disaster.
Sentence 75: It was the prospect of war profits that made our farmers in the West plow up prairie land that should never have been plowed, but should have been left for grazing cattle.
Sentence 76: Today we are reaping the harvest of those war profits in the dust storms which have devastated those war-plowed areas.
Sentence 77: It was the prospect of war profits that caused the extension of monopoly and unjustified expansion of industry and a price level so high that the normal relationship between debtor and creditor was destroyed.
Sentence 78: Nevertheless, if war should break out again in another continent, let us not blink the fact that we would find in this country thousands of Americans who, seeking immediate riches—fools' gold- would attempt to break down or evade our neutrality.
Sentence 79: They would tell you—and, unfortunately, their views would get wide publicity— that if they could produce and ship this and that and the other article to belligerent Nations, the unemployed of America would all find work.
Sentence 80: They would tell you that if they could extend credit to warring Nations that credit would be used in the United States to build homes and factories and pay our debts.
Sentence 81: They would tell you that America once more would capture the trade of the world.
Sentence 82: It would be hard to resist that clamor; it would be hard for many Americans, I fear, to look beyond—to realize the inevitable penalties, the inevitable day of reckoning, that come from a false prosperity.
Sentence 83: To resist the clamor of that greed, if war should come, would require the unswerving support of all Americans who love peace.
Sentence 84: If we face the choice of profits or peace, the Nation will answer—must answer—"We choose peace."
Sentence 85: It is the duty of all of us to encourage such a body of public opinion in this country that the answer will be clear and for all practical purposes unanimous.
Sentence 86: With that wise and experienced man who is our Secretary of State, whose statesmanship has met with such wide approval, I have thought and worked long and hard on the problem of keeping the United States at peace.
Sentence 87: But all the wisdom of America is not to be found in the White House or in the Department of State; we need the meditation, the prayer, and the positive support of the people of America who go along with us in seeking peace.
Sentence 88: No matter how well we are supported by neutrality legislation, we must remember that no laws can be provided to cover every contingency, for it is impossible to imagine how every future event may shape itself.
Sentence 89: In spite of every possible forethought, international relations involve of necessity a vast uncharted area.
Sentence 90: In that area safe sailing will depend on the knowledge and the experience and the wisdom of those who direct our foreign policy.
Sentence 91: Peace will depend on their day-to-day decisions.
Sentence 92: At this late date, with the wisdom which is so easy after the event and so difficult before the event, we find it possible to trace the tragic series of small decisions which led Europe into the Great War in 1914 and eventually engulfed us and many other Nations.
Sentence 93: We can keep out of war if those who watch and decide have a sufficiently detailed understanding of international affairs to make certain that the small decisions of each day do not lead toward war and if, at the same time, they possess the courage to say "no" to those who selfishly or unwisely would let us go to war.
Sentence 94: Of all the Nations of the world today we are in many ways most singularly blessed.
Sentence 95: Our closest neighbors are good neighbors.
Sentence 96: If there are remoter Nations that wish us not good but ill, they know that we are strong; they know that we can and will defend ourselves and defend our neighborhood.
Sentence 97: We seek to dominate no other Nation.
Sentence 98: We ask no territorial expansion.
Sentence 99: We oppose imperialism.
Sentence 100: We desire reduction in world armaments.
Sentence 101: We believe in democracy; we believe in freedom; we believe in peace.
Sentence 102: We offer to every Nation of the world the handclasp of the good neighbor.
Sentence 103: Let those who wish our friendship look us in the eye and take our hand.
