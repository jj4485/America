Sentence 1: 1948 The Presidents News Conference 381

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have no special announcements to make today, so if you want to ask questions I will try to answer them.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: Q. Mr. President, what prompted you to replace Mr. Eccles
1
with this Philadelphia Republican?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 5: That is my prerogative.
Sentence 6: I decided to make the change without anybody's request or influence.
Sentence 7: 1
Marriner S. Eccles, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (see Item 13).
Sentence 8: The President had nominated Thomas B. McCabe as Chairman.
Sentence 9: Q. Was it because--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 10: The President has a right to do that if he wants to do that.
Sentence 11: Q.
Sentence 12: Do you prefer Mr. McCabe's fiscal policies to Mr. Eccles's?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 13: That question I will not answer.
Sentence 14: Q. Mr. President, on that same question, Senator Tobey yesterday remarked that he was anxious to get to the bottom of what "forces"--I quote his words--"forces" persuaded you to make the change?
Sentence 15: Would you care to comment on Senator Tobey's remarks?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 16: The President, of course, hasn't the right to use his prerogative under the law, has he?
Sentence 17: Q. People would like an explanation, though.
Sentence 18: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 19: It has been thoroughly explained by Mr. Eccles and Mr. Snyder, and several of the--
Q. There will be no explanation?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 20: There will be no explanation.
Sentence 21: [2.]
Sentence 22: Q. Mr. President, does it look like meat rationing is imminent?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 23: Well, I can't tell you that.
Sentence 24: The meat situation is becoming very acute and requests have been made about the necessity for meat rationing by Members of the Congress.
Sentence 25: One of the Assistant Secretaries of Agriculture testified up there today, in answer to a question, that meat rationing undoubtedly would be imminent on account of the shortage of meat.
Sentence 26: The administration has not yet come to that conclusion.
Sentence 27: Q. Well, that statement of the Assistant Secretary was his own?
Sentence 28: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 29: I didn't see the statement.
Sentence 30: I don't know what he said.
Sentence 31: Q.
Sentence 32: I thought you said that he had--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: He had testified--I was told that he had testified up there that meat rationing was imminent.
Sentence 34: It may be true.
Sentence 35: I say that may be done--as soon as I get all the facts.
Sentence 36: Q. Mr. President, would it be fair to say that meat rationing is being considered?
Sentence 37: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: Yes, it is.
Sentence 39: Meat rationing has been considered ever since last November, when the request was made for certain powers in a standby capacity.
Sentence 40: Q. Mr. President, are you referring to Mr. Brannan?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 41: Yes.
Sentence 42: Q.
Sentence 43: He said that rationing without price control would be extremely risky.
Sentence 44: Do you agree with that?
Sentence 45: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 46: Yes indeed.
Sentence 47: Price control must come first.
Sentence 48: No use having rationing if you don't have price control.
Sentence 49: [After a pause in the questioning] Are you finished already?
Sentence 50: [Laughter]
Sentence 51: [3.]
Sentence 52: Q. No sir--what do you think about General Eisenhower getting out of the presidential--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: Wall, you know, General Eisenhower has the control of his own destiny, and if General Eisenhower thinks that was the best thing for General Eisenhower to do, I am for it.
Sentence 54: [Laughter]
Sentence 55: [4.]
Sentence 56: Q. Mr. President, Governor Folsom of Alabama, who incidentally is 6 feet 8 inches tall--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 57: Yes, he has been in here-we almost had to raise the doorjamb up.
Sentence 58: Q.--announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination the other day, and he was very critical of the administration.
Sentence 59: Have you anything to say about that?
Sentence 60: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 61: No.
Sentence 62: I have no comment.
Sentence 63: Anybody that wants to get a headline can attack the President and get it.
Sentence 64: [5.]
Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, Chairman Wolcott of the House Banking Committee has charged that the administration is sanctioning the use of American corn abroad to make whisky.
Sentence 66: Have you any comment, sir?
Sentence 67: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 68: I have no comment.
Sentence 69: I know nothing about any such sanctions.
Sentence 70: [6.]
Sentence 71: Q. Mr. President, you know there is a campaign on the Hill to lop that 2 billion 3 off the Marshall plan, or at least part of it.
Sentence 72: Do you have any comment on that?
Sentence 73: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: The matter was explicitly explained in the budget that, in order to get ready to put the Marshall plan into effect, it is necessary to make the--fill the pipeline, and that is what the 2 billion 3 is for.
Sentence 75: It is very clearly set out in the budget.
Sentence 76: And it is absolutely essential, if we are going to carry out the plan as it should be carried out.
Sentence 77: Q.
Sentence 78: Do you think that lopping it off later would tend to make it a relief rather than a recovery program?
Sentence 79: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 80: It would.
Sentence 81: The recovery program is what--we must have the recovery program, or there isn't any use starting it.
Sentence 82: Q. On the same subject, I wonder would you care to comment as to whether if the figure should be lopped the bulk of Latin America would suffer as a result?
Sentence 83: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: I can't answer that.
Sentence 85: I can't answer that question because I don't know.
Sentence 86: Q.
Sentence 87: I was just wondering; then you think the 6 billion 8 is essential?
Sentence 88: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: It iS absolutely essential.
Sentence 90: The program must be taken on as a whole over a period long enough to assure recovery in Europe.
Sentence 91: And that means peace in the world, if we can get recovery in Europe.
Sentence 92: And the plan was carefully thought out.
Sentence 93: It was worked on by the 16 nations that are interested in the matter.
Sentence 94: It was worked on in the State Department.
Sentence 95: It was worked on in the White House, and in the Cabinet.
Sentence 96: And the plan that we finally sent up to the Congress is one which we think will accomplish the purpose.
Sentence 97: And I think I told you once before that in 1945, along in October, after the Japanese had surrendered in August, I made a rescission of appropriations of 55 billions of dollars, and made a further rescission of some $7 billion--and a half, I think--in January or February, immediately following.
Sentence 98: That was for a 6-month period for war.
Sentence 99: That appropriation for 1946 fiscal year--from June 30, 1945, to June 30, 1946--was 103 billions of dollars.
Sentence 100: Now it does seem to me that we can afford, over a 4-year period, to risk 17 billions of dollars for peace, which is less than one fourth of the half-year that was made a rescission under war.
Sentence 101: It seems to me a very sane expenditure for peace.
Sentence 102: That is what we are after.
Sentence 103: And the recovery of Europe is essential before we can have peace.
Sentence 104: I feel very strongly on the subject.
Sentence 105: I think the welfare of this country and the welfare of the world is at stake in this European recovery plan.
Sentence 106: I don't think I can be any stronger--
Q. Mr. President, in order to get clarification, as that might be subject to misinterpretation, you said we must have this whole recovery program or there's no use starting it?
Sentence 107: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: That is correct.
Sentence 109: That is absolutely correct.
Sentence 110: Q. Should be all or nothing, sir?
Sentence 111: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 112: All or nothing. lust like throwing money down a rat hole unless we go through with the program and follow it to a logical conclusion.
Sentence 113: Q. A detail on that, sir.
Sentence 114: Many witnesses before the Foreign Relations Committee are for the plan in general, but many of them suggest that it will not be good--it will not be properly worked out by the State Department alone, and must have industrial and businessmen.
Sentence 115: Would you care to say anything about that?
Sentence 116: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: We expect to get the very best advice possible in the administration of the plan, and General Marshall is in favor of that, and so am I.
Sentence 118: And the administrative setup that I requested of the Congress is a sound one and is in line with what General Marshall wants.
Sentence 119: Q. Mr. President, on that line, Secretary Marshall yesterday said he was willing to accept the Brookings Institution--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: There is no difference between the Brookings plan and the one I sent the Congress, except in small details.
Sentence 121: Q.
Sentence 122: So it's all right with you?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 123: So it's all right with me.
Sentence 124: Q. Mr. President, what is your answer to the contention that the present Congress cannot commit future Congresses to the appropriation of such funds--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 125: That is not true.
Sentence 126: The Congress can make an authorization for contracts extending over a number of years.
Sentence 127: They do it all the time in reclamation and agriculture, and everything else.
Sentence 128: Q. Mr. President, does your statement "all or nothing" mean that you would reject a bill that was less than 6.8 in authorizations?
Sentence 129: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 130: I will attend to that when the bill comes up to me.
Sentence 131: It may be possible to reach a conclusion on the matter of a continuing program.
Sentence 132: And a continuing program is what I want.
Sentence 133: I don't want just a relief program for 1 year.
Sentence 134: We can talk about the money when it gets to me.
Sentence 135: Q. How can this Congress assure you, sir, of a continuing program?
Sentence 136: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 137: They can authorize the program, just as they authorize reclamation projects.
Sentence 138: Q. Does that mean, Mr. President, that you want to go back to the plan that existed before Vandenberg wrote the letter to the State Department, in which he--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 139: No, I don't think that affects them at all
Q.
Sentence 140: The $17 billion total?
Sentence 141: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 142: I don't think that affects them at all.
Sentence 143: I want a continuing program so that I know we are going to get the job done.
Sentence 144: The estimates are that it will take $17 billion to do it.
Sentence 145: Q.
Sentence 146: For authorizations that you couldn't commit--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 147: You can't commit more than one Congress on an appropriation, but you can commit the Congress on an authorization to carry out on a job.
Sentence 148: That is what I am after.
Sentence 149: Q.
Sentence 150: Then that is kind of a wedge for the appropriation?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 151: Certainly.
Sentence 152: That is what I want.
Sentence 153: Q. Mr. President, may we quote the words "all or nothing"?
Sentence 154: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 155: No, I think you had better not.
Sentence 156: They have been said by General Marshall, and I approve of what he said.
Sentence 157: [7.]
Sentence 158: Q. Mr. President, is Harry Woodring getting any consideration as civilian governor of Germany, when the State Department takes over on July 1?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 159: I am not commenting on personalities for that program yet, because it isn't in effect.
Sentence 160: [8.]
Sentence 161: Q. Mr. President, in connection with the "all or nothing" statement, does that apply to the 6 billion 8?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 162: No, that applies to the continuing program, to the whole continuing program.
Sentence 163: Q. $17 billion?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 164: The $17 billion program.
Sentence 165: To the 4-year program, let's put it that way.
Sentence 166: It may not be $17 billion, if Europe recovers faster than we think it will.
Sentence 167: They made a remarkable advance this year.
Sentence 168: Their products were increased by more than a billion dollars this year.
Sentence 169: [9.]
Sentence 170: Q. Mr. President, can I go back to an earlier question, sir?
Sentence 171: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 172: Sure.
Sentence 173: Q.
Sentence 174: You said there would be no explanation on the Eccles thing?
Sentence 175: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 176: That's right.
Sentence 177: Q. Does that mean that you believe then that the public is not entitled to an explanation on that?
Sentence 178: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 179: I think the President has a right to appoint the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board as the law requires, and appoint anybody he chooses.
Sentence 180: Q.
Sentence 181: Then, Mr. President, would you object to a Senate Banking and Currency Committee investigation of that appointment?
Sentence 182: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 183: No, I would have no objection.
Sentence 184: They can investigate anything they choose.
Sentence 185: They can't investigate the President.
Sentence 186: Q.
Sentence 187: They cannot?
Sentence 188: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 189: No --
Sentence 190: [laughter] -- the only way a President can be investigated is by impeachment.
Sentence 191: [10.]
Sentence 192: Q. Mr. President, the question of another big three conference came up at Secretary Marshall's press conference yesterday.
Sentence 193: He referred the matter to the President.
Sentence 194: Would you comment on--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 195: What was it?
Sentence 196: Q.--the present plan--Mr. Marshall was told that Mr. Churchill had suggested again the need for another big three meeting, and would he comment, and he said to ask the President to comment on the subject.
Sentence 197: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 198: I have no comment, for I haven't seen Mr. Churchill's remarks.
Sentence 199: I saw the quotes in the paper, but I don't know exactly what Mr. Churchill said.
Sentence 200: Q.
Sentence 201: But Mr. President
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 202: I have no comment.
Sentence 203: Q.
Sentence 204: You did say if there was going to be one, it would have to be in Washington.
Sentence 205: Is that still in your mind?
Sentence 206: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 207: Still in my mind.
Sentence 208: It ought to be here in Washington.
Sentence 209: [Laughter]
Sentence 210: [11.]
Sentence 211: Q. Mr. President, back to this Marshall plan--the bill as it stands now, if I recall correctly, carries a 4-year authorization without any stated sum of money.
Sentence 212: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 213: That's right.
Sentence 214: That's perfectly all right.
Sentence 215: That's what I want, a 4-year authorization to carry on the plan, and we will call appropriations from year to year as they come up.
Sentence 216: The Congress can't commit another Congress on an appropriation.
Sentence 217: They can commit one on an authorization.
Sentence 218: Q.
Sentence 219: But you are still opposed to lopping 2 billion 3--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 220: The 2 billion 3 should not come off.
Sentence 221: Q.
Sentence 222: Do you think the 2 billion 3 is necessary over the 4.5 billions--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 223: If I didn't think so, I wouldn't have put it in there.
Sentence 224: I asked for it in the first place.
Sentence 225: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 226: That's the only point of difference on the Hill at this point, Mr. President.
Sentence 227: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 228: Well, yes--and I think that won't be a point of difference when it is analyzed properly.
Sentence 229: If you will read one or two editorials which I have just been reading, you will find the analysis very good.
Sentence 230: One is in Bert Andrews' paper,
1
and the other is in Joe Fox's paper.
Sentence 231: 2
Giving him another plug!
