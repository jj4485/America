Sentence 3: Admiral Leahy, Admiral King, Admiral Nimitz, and Admiral Halsey; General Vandegrift, and Admiral Waesche--Watchee, however he pronounces that name.

Q. Republican
Sentence 12: what, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 13: He is a member of the Federal Power Commission.
Sentence 14: He is now on the Commission.
Sentence 15: A reappointment.
Sentence 16: Q.
Sentence 17: And what State is he from, sir?

Sentence 36: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 37: Permanent grade for life, with all the salary and emoluments that have gone with it during the wartime.
Sentence 38: And it creates for the President an elder statesmen organization for national defense.
Sentence 39: These men will not, under that increase, have to go into any advertising business, or go to work for any airplane companies, or anything else, for their support.
Sentence 40: That--for once, a Republic, I think, has been fair to the people who have taken it through one of the greatest emergencies in the history of the world.
Sentence 41: That's all that I have to announce
[2.]
Sentence 42: Q. Mr. President, to clear away any possible doubt, could you tell us whether Secretary Byrnes has your full support and backing, in pressing for immediate Security Council action on the Iranian question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 43: He certainly has, or he wouldn't be doing it.
Sentence 44: [3.]
Sentence 45: Q. Mr. President, in their half-hour discussion with you this afternoon, did Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Flynn of New York State discuss with you the possibility of Senator Mead's candidacy for Governor of New York State?
Sentence 46: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: They discussed every phase of the New York political situation, and I was very much interested, and was a very careful listener.
Sentence 48: They did discuss Senator Mead's candidacy for Governor of New York.
Sentence 49: Q.
Sentence 50: What did they say about it?
Sentence 51: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: They said that he could be elected.
Sentence 53: Q. Did they know whether he would run, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 54: I didn't ask them that.
Sentence 55: [4.]
Sentence 56: Q. Mr. President, it was suggested on the Hill this morning that you call a Big Three conference.
Sentence 57: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: They have been making that for months, I think.
Sentence 59: The same answer is the same.
Sentence 60: [5.]
Sentence 61: Q. Mr. President, getting back to the New York political situation again [laughter]--if I may .
Sentence 62: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: Go ahead.
Sentence 64: Q.--and
Sentence 65: I don't like to ask what might seem to be a badgering question, but if I could ask, how it squares with your answer of a week ago or so, that you were willing and able to discuss Missouri politics, but that you weren't ready to discuss New York politics?
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: That is correct.
Sentence 68: It's just as correct today as it was then.
Sentence 69: I was a listener to two able New York politicians.
Sentence 70: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us anything, sir, about the possibility of Mr. Mead running?
Sentence 71: Do you think he will?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 72: I don't know a thing about it.
Sentence 73: The best way to do is to talk to Senator Mead.
Sentence 74: He is available.
Sentence 75: Q. Thank you, sir!
Sentence 76: [Laughter]
Sentence 77: [6.]
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, when it was announced that you would postpone the atom bomb tests, the primary reason--official reason-given at that time was that it would take too many Congressmen out of Washington.
Sentence 79: 1
Yesterday, Speaker Rayburn said that things were going so well in Congress on emergency legislation that they could have a spring recess.
Sentence 80: How do those two things fit together?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: I haven't talked to Speaker Rayburn on a spring recess, but the reason expressed in the release is exactly the reason why the atomic bomb plan was postponed.
Sentence 82: 1
On March 23 the Press Secretary to the president had announced that the tests scheduled for May 15 and July 1 would be delayed for about 6 weeks.
Sentence 83: The reason given for the delay was that a large number of Congressmen had expressed a desire to witness both tests but owing to the heavy legislative schedule would be prevented from doing so if the tests were held on the dates originally fixed.
Sentence 84: Q.
Sentence 85: I just wondered if anything had happened in Congress since then, that made it possible for them--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 86: No.
Q.--to take a recess?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: The best way is to discuss that with the leaders in Congress.
Sentence 88: Q. Mr. President, have you got any letters for or against the test?
Sentence 89: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 90: No, I haven't.
Sentence 91: Q.
Sentence 92: You have not?
Sentence 93: Q.
Sentence 94: In this morning's paper, Mr. President, there was a story that another factor in that delay was the construction of measuring instruments--of instruments to help measure the effect of the blast.
Sentence 95: Is that also true?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: I haven't heard it.
Sentence 97: The first I've heard it.
Sentence 98: The reason was the one expressed in the release, and no other reason affected my postponing the test.
Sentence 99: [7.]
Sentence 100: Q. Mr. President, in light of the threatened famine of food all over the world, you asked the American people to save food, and the situation which developed in California, where there is a threat to cut off food because of jurisdictional strikes, I am wondering whether you consider that is important enough to step in on this plan of regarding it
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: That is a matter that is being handled by the Labor Department, and I hope by the Governor of California-just as I told you last time it was brought up.
Sentence 102: [8.]
Sentence 103: Q.
Sentence 104: In view of your professed backing of Secretary Byrnes, do you have any misgivings about Russia taking a permanent walk?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 105: No, I haven't.
Sentence 106: [9.]
Sentence 107: Q. Mr. President, along the line of the food situation, the UNRRA food subcommittee, following Governor Lehman's lead, has suggested all the United Nations going back to food rationing.
Sentence 108: Have you got an appeal on that?
Sentence 109: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 110: The--as I said the last time that this was brought up, the thing, if it became absolutely essential and the emergency was of a long enough duration that it would be necessary for us to go back to food rationing, I certainly would be in favor of doing it.
Sentence 111: But this is an emergency proposition, and the reimplementation of food rationing would take longer than the emergency is supposed to last.
Sentence 112: It is only supposed to last until the spring wheat crop can be gotten in.
Sentence 113: Q.
Sentence 114: There isn't very much likelihood
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 115: Not for this emergency.
Sentence 116: [10.]
Sentence 117: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us whether other names came into your political conversation with the two gentlemen from New York?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 118: No, I don't remember.
Sentence 119: The best thing for you is to talk it over with them.
Sentence 120: I remember particularly that they did discuss Senator Mead.
Sentence 121: Q. Mr. President, does that mean that you are backing Senator Mead for the gubernatorial nomination--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 122: I told you that I did not interfere in New York politics, outside of the State of Missouri.
Sentence 123: Q. Did you state to them, Mr. President, the particular feeling that you expressed a couple of weeks ago, that you thought Senators ought to remain in the Senate?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 124: I did not discuss that phase of the matter.
Sentence 125: When it comes up to me, I will discuss it.
Sentence 126: [11.]
Sentence 127: Q. Mr. President, from New York there are some reports that Mr. Byrnes has been talking to you about this deadlocked Security Council.
Sentence 128: There is also speculation on reports that there is a possibility that you or he might try to get some help from Mr. Stalin.
Sentence 129: I am wondering if anything like that is in the wind?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 130: It hasn't been discussed.
Sentence 131: Mr. Byrnes is in touch with me every day.
Sentence 132: He just phoned me a half hour ago on the situation.
Sentence 133: Q.
Sentence 134: What did he say, Mr. President?
Sentence 135: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 136: He said that the matter would come up at 4 o'clock, and it would be discussed at the Security Council.
Sentence 137: I have no comment to make on what may happen.
Sentence 138: Q.
Sentence 139: The matter of Russia leaving.
Sentence 140: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 141: The matter that was under discussion--whatever it was.
Sentence 142: Q.
Sentence 143: The matter that was under discussion between you and Secretary Byrnes?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 144: No.
Sentence 145: The matter that is under discussion at the Security Council, will come up at 4 o'clock, and we hope to settle it.
Sentence 146: [12.]
Sentence 147: Q. Mr. President, would you care to make any comment on the special State Department report on international control of atomic energy, which will be released at 8 o'clock tonight?
Sentence 148: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 149: No.
Sentence 150: I have no comment to make.
Sentence 151: It hasn't been released yet.
Sentence 152: [13.]
Sentence 153: Q. Mr. President, have you had any reactions from Congress to your appeal of last Saturday night, on party unity and responsibility?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 154: Yes, I have had lots of responses from Congress.
Sentence 155: They are in favor of it, most of them.
Sentence 156: [14.]
Sentence 157: Q. Mr. President, did Mr. Baruch tell you he wanted his name withheld from consideration--consideration at this time?
Sentence 158: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 159: I think he told Senator Connally that he would like to have it delayed, and I confirmed that statement to Senator Connally.
Sentence 160: Q.
Sentence 161: Yes.
Sentence 162: Do you know of any reason for that?
Sentence 163: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 164: No, I don't.
Sentence 165: You had better ask Mr. Baruch.
Sentence 166: [15.]
Sentence 167: Q. I want to ask you about that tie that caused so much--[laughter]--is that--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 168: You know, that tie seems to have caused more trouble than the speech itself.
Sentence 169: And as I said, I have had that necktie, I think, for 4 or 5 years, and have worn it on several occasions.
Sentence 170: I think I wore it at the Gridiron dinner, if I am not mistaken.
Sentence 171: No comment was made on it then, because you people were familiar with such a tie.
Sentence 172: Q.
Sentence 173: You weren't setting any such new style?
Sentence 174: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 175: No
Q. Just interested in it--indicating that things are getting back to normal?
Sentence 176: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 177: I think so, yes.
Sentence 178: It makes me very happy.
Sentence 179: [16.]
Sentence 180: Q. Mr. President, there are reports that Secretary Forrestal has started organizing a civilian advisory committee--invited about 75 or 100 very prominent people to belong to it--advisory committee to the Navy Department; and some of the proponents of the merger of the armed services say that it--actually it's an antimerger organization--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 181: I haven't heard.
Sentence 182: I haven't heard about it.
Sentence 183: Q. Haven't heard about the organization?
Sentence 184: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 185: No.
Sentence 186: It hasn't been discussed with me.
Sentence 187: [17.]
Sentence 188: Q. Mr. President, have you made your selection of the--for the Under Secretary nomination?

Sentence 192: I will announce it to you when I get ready.
Sentence 193: [18.]
Sentence 194: Q. Do you expect a coal strike, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 195: I have no comment to make on that.
Sentence 196: Your guess is as good as mine.
Sentence 197: [19.]
Sentence 198: Q. Mr. President, do you expect to issue a statement or proclamation any time, when Mr. Small and Mr. Wyatt get ready with the real--put all the details of their program for these construction committees into effect, which requires a great deal of civilian cooperation?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 199: Whatever it takes we will proceed to do, to get that program put through.
Sentence 200: That is one we are really behind, with everything we have.
Sentence 201: Q. Mr. President, are there any plans for Government seizure of the mines, in case of a strike?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 202: No, there are not.
Sentence 203: [20.]
Sentence 204: Q.
Sentence 205: [In broken English, unintelligible, about food and South America.]
Sentence 206: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 207: I am sorry, I didn't understand the question.
Sentence 208: Would you please repeat it for me?
Sentence 209: Q.
Sentence 210: [Repeated, and still unintelligible.
Sentence 211: ]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 212: I am hoping that South America will join us in sending food to Europe, and I am sure they will.

Sentence 214: Thank you, Mr. President.
