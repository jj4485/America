Sentence 2: The Presidents News Conference 643

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: I have received a report from Mr. Snyder, head of OWMR, on the housing situation, which will be handed to you.
Sentence 5: It is a mimeographed sheet of three pages, and recommends the appointment of a Housing Expediter to carry out the suggestions which he makes to me and which I have approved.
Sentence 6: And I am appointing the Honorable Wilson Wyatt, former Mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, to that position; and a copy of my letter to him, and Mr. Snyder's report, are available for you.
Sentence 7: Q. Mr. President, does that reinstitute priority controls on building materials?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 8: Eventually it will.
Sentence 9: Q.
Sentence 10: Eventually it will?
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 12: Yes.
Sentence 13: It is completely explained in there.
Sentence 14: Q. Could you give us a brief resume, in 20 well-chosen words, Mr. President?
Sentence 15: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 16: Well, if you are going to insist on having something read to you--well, I will do that.
Sentence 17: [Reading] "The first step is a program for speeding up release of surplus housing units and building materials, held by the Government.
Sentence 18: It is ready to operate.
Sentence 19: "This program makes immediately available to the States and local communities surplus Government property suitable for housing, including Army and Navy barracks and dormitories.
Sentence 20: Wherever possible these facilities, many of which are near crowded cities, will be utilized on their present sites to house veterans and their families.
Sentence 21: "
That's the first one.
Sentence 22: [Continuing reading] "The second step is a regulation which is now being prepared and which should be released before the middle of the month, establishing priorities on building materials.
Sentence 23: "In general terms, this regulation will establish such priorities for single or multiple dwelling housing units costing $10,000 or less per unit.
Sentence 24: This will mean that about 50 percent of all building materials will be channeled into this type of building.
Sentence 25: The balance will be available for commercial, industrial, higher-priced dwelling, and all other construction--public and private.
Sentence 26: "The third step relates to ceiling prices on old and new housing.
Sentence 27: Sharp increases in the price of housing already have occurred.
Sentence 28: The threat of inflation in this field is the most menacing in our economy, and we are using all the powers that have been granted the Administration to combat it."
It goes into further explanation on each one of those, with the preliminary statement of why it is done.
Sentence 29: [Continuing reading] "First, to increase the supply of building materials; second, to strengthen inventory controls to prevent hoarding; third, to strengthen price controls over building materials; fourth, to discourage unsound lending practices and speculation; fifth, to enlist industry support in increasing production and fighting inflation; and sixth, to provide information and advisory service on home values to the public.
Sentence 30: "
And you have all that entirely and completely set out in this memorandum.
Sentence 31: 1

The full text of Mr. Snyder's memorandum was released by the White House.
Sentence 32: Q. Mr. President, are those price ceilings operative right away?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: Just as soon as we can get the orders out.
Sentence 34: Q.
Sentence 35: You don't have to have OPA come in on that at all?
Sentence 36: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 37: It will be--yes, yes.
Sentence 38: Q. Mr. President, no legislation will be necessary on it?
Sentence 39: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 40: No, because this is under the War Powers Act--this is under the War Powers Act, although we are supporting certain legislation which is explained in here that will help implement that.
Sentence 41: 2

After the news conference the White House issued a release clarifying the President's reply as follows:
"The President made this reply under a misapprehension.
Sentence 42: Legislation is necessary to fix Price ceilings.
Sentence 43: The memorandum issued today points that out on Page 3, Section 3,
"Legislation is not necessary for the establishment of priorities on building materials; and, as indicated in Section 2, on Page 3 of the memorandum, priorities are being set up under the War Powers Act without legislation.
Sentence 44: "The President in answering the question was under the impression that the question referred to priorities rather than price ceilings,"
Sentence 45: [2.]
Sentence 46: Then, I am appointing the fact finding board for the General Motors strike: Judge Walter Parker Stacy; Lloyd K. Garrison, chairman of the War Labor Board; and Milton S. Eisenhower, president of the Kansas State College, in Manhattan.
Sentence 47: Q.
Sentence 48: Just a minute--Milton S. Eisenhower, what's he president --
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 49: President of Kansas State College, in Manhattan-that's an agricultural college in Kansas.
Sentence 50: Lloyd Garrison, who heads the War Labor Board, and Judge Stacy was chairman of the
Q. Mr. President, may I ask you a question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 51: Certainly.
Sentence 52: Q.
Sentence 53: This General Motors thing--as you probably know, labor has put up an.--
Q. Louder.
Sentence 54: Q.--argument that the fact finding--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: Say that again.
Sentence 56: Q.
Sentence 57: I say that I am asking--saying to the President that, as he probably knows, labor objects to the idea of fact finding boards, with their argument being that they could string out the time of the fact finding to an interminable degree.
Sentence 58: I thought possibly this might be a good time to ask you a question about that, what your comment is on it?
Sentence 59: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 60: My comment is that it is specifically stated in the message that the fact finding period should be 20 days--5 days to get .ready, and 5 days after the 20 days--making up 30 days altogether; so this fact finding program can't last more than 20 days.
Sentence 61: Q. Is it somewhere in your proposal--do you not authorize them to have more time if they want it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 62: If it is absolutely essential.

Sentence 64: You know what I am talking about?
Sentence 65: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: Yes.
Sentence 67: Q.
Sentence 68: It has been brought up that it was a device for stopping all labor--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 69: I don't think it is any such device.
Sentence 70: It is merely a program for the purpose of finding out exactly what the conditions are on labor's side and on management's side, and then making a recommendation that is fair to the public.
Sentence 71: That's the principle of the thing.
Sentence 72: [3.]
Sentence 73: Q. Mr. President, in connection with the inflationary aspects of the real estate market, are you also looking into the very active stock market now?
Sentence 74: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 75: I hadn't been looking into it.
Sentence 76: In fact, I have had so many things to think about that I hadn't looked at the stock market, because I have never been interested in the stock market personally.
Sentence 77: [4.]
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, will this fact finding board have the right to go into the company's books?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: Not without legislation.
Sentence 80: I am of the opinion that people will want to cooperate with the President of the United States in an effort to settle these strikes in the public interest.
Sentence 81: Q.
Sentence 82: You expect the company to open its books?

Sentence 84: I expect cooperation from both sides.
Sentence 85: [5.]

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: Just as quickly as we can get it ready.
Sentence 92: [6.]
Sentence 93: Q. Mr. President, in addition to criticism of the labor program, there have been some personal attacks on you.
Sentence 94: I wonder if you could say how you regarded those?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 95: I didn't even read them.
Sentence 96: I am not interested in them.
Sentence 97: I don't think there's any truth in them, so why worry about them.
Sentence 98: I have been attacked before.
Sentence 99: [7.].
Sentence 100: Q-We have received some reports that Senator Maybank might be appointed to some diplomatic post, specifically Brazil--a possibility of a vacancy there?

Sentence 101: News to me.
Sentence 102: That's the first I have heard of it.
Sentence 103: [8.]
Sentence 104: Q. Mr. President, I have been asked to inquire when the Marines will be taken out of China?
Sentence 105: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 106: The Marines will be taken out of China when our surrender terms with Japan have been carried out.
Sentence 107: At a later time, when General Marshall starts for China, I shall announce a complete policy for the guidance of General Marshall; and I will announce it here at a press conference.
Sentence 108: [9.]
Sentence 109: Q. To get back to labor, Mr. President, I believe in your message you asked that the enabling legislation be passed before the Christmas recess.
Sentence 110: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: I did.
Sentence 112: Q. Indications on the Hill now are that action will not be completed by the time for the recess.
Sentence 113: Are you doing anything to expedite that?

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 118: Yes.
Sentence 119: Q.
Sentence 120: Do you take into consideration the possibility of a great deal of conversation on the subject in the Senate?
Sentence 121: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 122: The Senate is always entitled to conversation.
Sentence 123: That's one of the reasons for the existence of the Senate.
Sentence 124: [Laughter] That's the only legislative body left in the world with unlimited debate, and under no circumstances would I limit that debate.
Sentence 125: I have been a Senator, and I know what it means for a Senator not to be able to say what he pleases.
Sentence 126: [Laughter]
Sentence 127: [10.]
Sentence 128: I have another appointment here that I think you will be interested in.

Sentence 130: Mr. Straus will be Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation.
Sentence 131: Q. Does that interfere with his present job at all, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 132: He is resigning as Assistant Secretary of the Interior to take this job.
Sentence 133: Q. How does Mr. Bashore spell his name?
Sentence 134: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 135: I will spell it for you.
Sentence 136: I have got it right here: B-a-s-h-o-r-e.
Sentence 137: His name is Harry W.
Q. Mr. President, Mike is a very close associate of Mr. Harold Ickes.
Sentence 138: Should we take that move as any indication of a move on Mr. Ickes' part in the future?
Sentence 139: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 140: No, I don't think so.
Sentence 141: He is a very capable person and has done an excellent job as Assistant Secretary, and comes to me highly recommended by everybody in connection with the thing; and so I appointed him.
Sentence 142: That's a job that needs to be well done.
Sentence 143: [11.]
