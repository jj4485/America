Sentence 1: 1940 Press Conference 7

Q. Mr. President, I think the country would like to know whether you were closer than Mr. Gallup on your electoral vote?
Sentence 2: THE PRESIDENT: I was away off.
Sentence 3: My guess was made, as you know, way back about the first of August, and I saw no reason at any time in the campaign to change it.
Sentence 4: My guess was 340 electoral votes for me.
Sentence 5: Q. 340?
Sentence 6: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 7: Yes.
Sentence 8: I was away off. . .
Sentence 9: .
Sentence 10: Up there at Hyde Park the boys had a pool on different sections and regions and, basing the thing more or less on that 340 I lost them all.
Sentence 11: Q. Mr. President, what State surprised you?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 12: Well, about a hundred and ten votes did.
Sentence 13: Q. Would you care to identify them further?
Sentence 14: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 15: No.
Sentence 16: Q.
Sentence 17: Mr. President, the Pan American Union Governing Board, representing the twenty-one American nations, congratulated you unanimously on your election and expressed the view that the vote was an endorsement of the Good Neighbor policy.
Sentence 18: Could you—
THE PRESIDENT: [interposing] That was awfully nice of them.
Sentence 19: Q. Do you share that view?
Sentence 20: THE PRESIDENT: I think they probably were correct.
Sentence 21: Q. Mr. President, did you get anything from Herr Hitler or Mussolini?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 22: No.
Q. I understood you got something from Marshal Pe'tain?
Sentence 23: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 24: No.
Sentence 25: It may be here, Constantine
Sentence 26: [Mr. Brown],but I haven't seen anything.
Sentence 27: Q.
Sentence 28: But Hitler did not say anything?
Sentence 29: THE PRESIDENT: No—not yet.
Sentence 30: Q. Mr. President, there have been suggestions from the public and the press and in conversations that you might have Cabinet changes to the extent of asking Mr. Willkie into the Cabinet or a Government position.
Sentence 31: Have you anything to say about that, seriously?
THE PRESIDENT: Only this, that I have not considered anything along those lines one way or the other, and I have to warn everybody, off the record, that this kind of a story [indicating the newspaper in front of him] is silly.
Sentence 32: Where was it?
Sentence 33: Oh, yes
Sentence 34: [reading],
"That some Cabinet changes were likely was reported in New Deal circles."
Sentence 35: [The President was quoting from the front page of The New York Times of even date.]
Sentence 36: What I want to emphasize is that it was not reported in New Deal circles; it was written in this particular office.
Sentence 37: And the next sentence [reading],
"It was said that the resignation, etc."
It was not said in official quarters, it was written in the office.
Sentence 38: Q. Is that off the record?
Sentence 39: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 40: No, you can use that if you want to.
Sentence 41: Q.
Sentence 42: [Mr. Godwin]
Sentence 43: As a matter of personal defense, every time I ask you a question and you pick up a newspaper, they say that it is a planted question.
Sentence 44: Will you solve that?
Sentence 45: (Laughter)
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 46: I will solve it.
Sentence 47: I will say, "Earl, it was not a planted question."
Sentence 48: (Laughter)
Q.
Sentence 49: [Mr. Godwin] I happen to be well informed; that is all.
Sentence 50: (Laughter)
Sentence 51: Q. Mr. President, toward the end of the campaign you made certain statements that were regarded by many people as indicating that you would not accept a fourth term.
Sentence 52: Did you definitely mean that?
Sentence 53: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 54: Well, the question is this: Oughtn't you go back to grade school and learn English?
Sentence 55: It was perfectly clear to me and to almost everybody else in this country.
Sentence 56: Q.
Sentence 57: That was your meaning?
Sentence 58: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 59: Well, read it.
Sentence 60: I am not teaching you English.
Sentence 61: Read it.
Sentence 62: Q. I have read it, sir.
Sentence 63: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 64: Well, read it again.
Sentence 65: It was a statement, and perfectly plain English.
Sentence 66: Read it again. . . .
Sentence 67: Q. Mr. President, anything you have in mind now that would require the attention of Congress between this time and the first of January?
Sentence 68: THE PRESIDENT: I cannot tell you because I have not seen the Congressional leaders yet.
Sentence 69: Most of them are away
Sentence 70: and I suppose they will be back on Monday, and I shall see them then. . . .
Sentence 71: Q.
Sentence 72: You met yesterday with the Defense Commission and we were told afterward that the Priorities Board was meeting and might give consideration to this 12,000-plane order for Great Britain.
Sentence 73: Anything definite on that yet?
Sentence 74: THE PRESIDENT: I would not put it that way.
Sentence 75: You see, the Priorities Board would not take up things like completed articles, among them planes, which is a completed article.
Sentence 76: They will take up, in the first instance, certain component parts, of which there might be shortages, that go into a completed article.
Sentence 77: In other words, suppose, for the sake of argument, there were orders for 12,000 planes.
Sentence 78: First, they would look into the question of the manufacturing facilities, the buildings and the labor, skilled labor, and the assembly end of it, and the putting together of the thing, and then they would say, "Where are bottlenecks?
Sentence 79: What are we short of?"
Sentence 80: Now, there might be some essential things we were short of, especially raw materials, so far as getting them up to the line on time.
Sentence 81: Well, just for example, just trying to illustrate, yesterday we talked about the steel situation.
Sentence 82: Probably, through the winter, until next spring when the Great Lakes are open again, there won't be any ingot shortage.
Sentence 83: In other words, there is enough ore on hand to make ingots—to keep that going.
Sentence 84: On the other hand, there might be a shortage of manufacturing facilities for some steel process after the ingots are all melted down.
Sentence 85: There might be a shortage of rolling facilities, or stamping facilities, or something of that kind.
Sentence 86: So that is what the Priorities Board is doing at the present time, to check on the primal bottlenecks at the bottom of the line.
Sentence 87: Q. Mr. President, in dealing with this request of 12,000 planes, you said the Defense Commission had been asked to give its sympathetic consideration.
Sentence 88: Has that sympathetic consideration resulted in a final decision?
Sentence 89: THE PRESIDENT: Not yet; it is being studied.
Sentence 90: Q. Anything to be said about Kennedy
Sentence 91: [Ambassador to Great Britain] as to whether or not he will go back to London?
Sentence 92: Any news?
Sentence 93: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 94: No.
Sentence 95: He is carrying on and giving us some very valuable information.
Sentence 96: Q.
Sentence 97: There was a suggestion from somewhere that he is going to remain here and go into defense work?
Sentence 98: THE PRESIDENT: We are just talking.
Sentence 99: He probably will be in touch with me for the next few weeks on information he has and advice.
Sentence 100: Q. Mr. President, from general word I got from Buffalo, it seems on your trip you qualified pretty much as an expert.
Sentence 101: Larry
Sentence 102: [Lawrence] Bell said he never had anyone ask him so many technical questions on airplane production.
Sentence 103: Can you tell us anything at all about the two plants you saw up there on your visit?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 104: I think they were getting on pretty well.
Sentence 105: I don't pretend to be an expert; but, having started in on the problem of industrial output in the year 1913, I know some of the major questions that ought to be asked in manufacturing plants to bring out things.
Sentence 106: Q. Mr. President, what happened to your idea of locating the steel industry on the West Coast?
Sentence 107: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 108: They are going ahead with that.
Sentence 109: They are turning out more and more of certain types of steel, and we are studying the putting in of manufacturing of other types of steel out there.
Sentence 110: For instance, you take this new plant up on the Columbia River.
Sentence 111: It is an aluminum plant and it is hoped that they will build not only the aluminum billets that they will make out there, but that they will do the manufacturing there instead of shipping them east and then shipping the finished aluminum back west again.
Sentence 112: Q.
Sentence 113: Who can use the word "priority" on completed articles to which the Government has not yet taken title?
Sentence 114: I mean, such as airplanes?
Sentence 115: Is it possible that Britain could get airplanes almost completed and then they could be turned over—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 116: [interposing] Well, that has nothing to do with priority.
Sentence 117: Q.
Sentence 118: That is not under the Priorities Board but who will make the decision in that case?
Sentence 119: Army and Navy?
Sentence 120: THE PRESIDENT: Probably come up through the Army and Navy to me, I suppose.
Sentence 121: It has in the past.
Sentence 122: Q. Is there any movement along that line now?
Sentence 123: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 124: No. I will tell you, there is one thing which you might as well print.
Sentence 125: I think it is all right.
Sentence 126: I am very often called "The rule of thumb man."
Sentence 127: Quite a long while ago, about three weeks, four weeks ago, there came a question about munitions of various kinds for Canada and Great Britain, as they came of[ the line, where we both needed the same thing.
Sentence 128: Q.
Sentence 129: That is what I meant.
Sentence 130: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 131: And I laid down a rule of thumb, which is only a general rule and, of course, is absolutely subject to exceptions.
Sentence 132: And the rule is a 50-50 rule.
Sentence 133: In other words, we take half; they take half.
Sentence 134: Q. Does that apply to the large bombing planes, the flying fortresses?
Sentence 135: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 136: Yes, yes.
Sentence 137: Q. Mr. President, does that 50-50 rule apply to big bombers, meaning also flying' fortresses?
Sentence 138: THE PRESIDENT: As they come off the line, I should say yes, the new ones.
Sentence 139: Q. Would it apply to planes that are now coming off the lines?
Sentence 140: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 141: Yes and no.
Sentence 142: In other words, we might need more than the fifty per cent for a while, or there might be some article that we needed less than fifty per cent for the next few months.
Sentence 143: But, as I say, it is only a rule of thumb, subject to many exceptions in the case of an individual article.
Sentence 144: Q. Does this 50-50 ratio increase the ratio that has been in existence for the past several months, or by how much does it increase it?
Sentence 145: THE PRESIDENT: I should say a little bit.
Sentence 146: I think before that it was perhaps 55-45 and now it is 50-50.
Sentence 147: Q.
Sentence 148: The 55-45 being in favor of the United States?
Sentence 149: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 150: Yes.
Sentence 151: Q. Have you in mind any arrangement with Mexico paralleling that which we have with Canada?
Sentence 152: THE PRESIDENT: I think that the armies of both countries have been carrying on studies, joint studies.
Sentence 153: Didn't we have the chief of staff of the Mexican Army up here?
Sentence 154: Q. Yes, sir.
Sentence 155: Q. Reports have been circulating in usually good quarters in Europe that some sort of peace move may be anticipated in Washington in the next few weeks.
Sentence 156: The reports seem to say that one step in the move would be the withdrawal of Germany from Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands.
Sentence 157: Have you heard such a report?
Sentence 158: THE PRESIDENT: I never even heard of it; never even read it.
Sentence 159: The same way, there was a U. P. report this morning of some kind of agreement—I don't know what it said; I think it said, "High official sources in London," and I am quite sure it did not come from high official sources in London- about an agreement among Great Britain, Australia and the United States.
Sentence 160: I am quite sure it did not come from high sources.
Sentence 161: Q.
Sentence 162: You mean regarding Singapore, Mr. President?
Sentence 163: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 164: Yes.
Sentence 165: I am afraid it was just another one.
Sentence 166: Q.
Sentence 167: That is to say that such an understanding does not even agree in principle?
Sentence 168: THE PRESIDENT: I should say the report did not come from any high official sources.
Sentence 169: We will confine ourselves to that.
Sentence 170: Q. Mr. President, London is wondering whether you might use your good offices to bring Churchill and De Valera together on the question of the use of Irish ports?
Sentence 171: THE PRESIDENT: I don't know, George
Sentence 172: [Mr. Durno]; I never heard of it.
Sentence 173: Q.
Sentence 174: Also I have been requested to ask whether any immediate Federal funds are in sight for this Washington-Baltimore Boulevard as a national defense project?
Sentence 175: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Sentence 176: The last I heard about that was when I went to the aviation plant that day.
Sentence 177: As we came back, you known, from Aberdeen, the Governor of Maryland [Governor O'Conor] told me that he had a board or something that was looking into the question.
Sentence 178: He said he would let me know about it as soon as they made a report.
Sentence 179: I have not heard anything since then.
