Sentence 3: TACNA-ARICA DISPUTE
The Tacna-Arica dispute has been settled.1 The State Department told me a few minutes ago that they would have the whole of the documentation ready for you, they thought, at 4 o'clock, so that you can get it from them.
Sentence 4: I have nothing to add to the particular publication of it, and there is no particular background to it so far as I know except that after some 7 or 8 years it is settled.
Sentence 5: I think that is all I have got on my mind.
Sentence 6: 1 A longstanding dispute between Chile and Peru over possession of the provinces of Tacna and Arica was settled on the basis of a compromise suggested by Mr. Hoover after his preinaugural tour of Central and South America.
