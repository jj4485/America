Sentence 1: 1950 The Presidents News Conference 584
Sentence 2: [Held in the Indian Treaty Room, Executive Office Building]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: I think I had better make a statement to you about this proposed change.
Sentence 5: It occurred to me that it would be more comfortable for you.
Sentence 6: I know it will be more comfortable for me to be able to see everybody, and for everybody to be able to hear what is said.
Sentence 7: That room over across the street is built in such a manner that the acoustics are not good.
Sentence 8: Whenever I have a conference of any importance where there are more than three people present, I always move it back in the Cabinet Room.
Sentence 9: I want the procedure to go just as it always has, and when the top White House correspondent gets tired, or thinks he wants to say "Thank you, Mr. President," we will quit.
Sentence 10: Q. Mr. President, will you please speak a little bit louder?
Sentence 11: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 12: I will.
Sentence 13: Maybe I'll have to put a mike up here, if you can't hear back there.
Sentence 14: I thought you could.
Sentence 15: I could hear you much better than I could hear you over in that other room.
Sentence 16: [2.]
Sentence 17: I have an announcement to make.
Sentence 18: Stanley Woodward is going to be the Ambassador to Canada.
Sentence 19: And just a day or two after the leak came about in Canada, he called up Mr. Connelly,
1
and wanted to know if the proposed new Ambassador to Canada could see the President.
Sentence 20: And Mr. Connelly told him that he would have to take it up with protocol in the State Department if he expected to see me.
Sentence 21: [Laughter]
1 Matthew J. Connelly, Secretary to the President.
Sentence 22: [3.]
Sentence 23: I am interested in the reorganization 'plans that are now before the Congress.
Sentence 24: I sent down 21 of them.
Sentence 25: 2
They have resolutions against 8 of them introduced in the Senate, and I think 5 in the House.
Sentence 26: 2
See Items 53-76.
Sentence 27: Now, if we are going to have efficiency in the Government--we spent an immense amount of money, and a lot of time.
Sentence 28: And the commission headed by Mr. Hoover and Dean Acheson brought in an excellent report.
Sentence 29: I have had the executive branch of the Government working on that report ever since it came in.
Sentence 30: And as fast as we get these reorganization plans ready, I have been sending them down to the Congress.
Sentence 31: And I think if we are going to make any sincere effort to carry out that able and efficient report in an able and efficient manner--we must remember that the reason the Congress itself has not been able to make the necessary reorganization of the Government by law is because every single one of them has some special reasons added on to get this thing or that thing done--every one of these reorganization plans will tend to increase the efficiency of the Government
Sentence 32: And I am exceedingly anxious that those 21 plans be approved.
Sentence 33: I am working on other plans now, which I will send down to this session of Congress before it adjourns, as soon as we get them ready.
Sentence 34: And I sincerely hope that they will all be approved.
Sentence 35: That's all I have to say, gentlemen.
Sentence 36: I will answer all the questions I can, if you will ask them.
Sentence 37: Q. Mr. President, how many more plans do you expect to have ?
Sentence 38: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 39: We are going to keep on until we have lined up that five-volume report.
Sentence 40: I don't know how long it will take, or how many plans it will take.
Sentence 41: [4.]
Sentence 42: Q. Mr. President, I wonder if you are familiar with the RFC loans being investigated by the Fulbright committee
3
up on the Hill?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 43: No, I am not.
Sentence 44: That is what I have had the RFC for, to make the investigation of those loans.
Sentence 45: I am not familiar with them.
Sentence 46: 3 Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee.
Sentence 47: [5.]
Sentence 48: Q. Mr. President, one of the results of the McCarthy
4
investigation has been a countercharge that he is being fed material by Nationalist China sources.
Sentence 49: I wonder if you would care to make any comment on the suggestion raised by several publications, including the New Republic, for an investigation of the so-called China lobby?
Sentence 50: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 51: It seems to me that that is a question you ought to ask the chairman of the committee.
Sentence 52: Let him find out.
Sentence 53: I have no comment on it.
Sentence 54: [At this point there was a pause in the questioning.
Sentence 55: ]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 56: Don't be bashful, gentlemen!
Sentence 57: [Laughter]
4 Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin, member of the Investigations Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments.
Sentence 58: [6.]
Sentence 59: Q. Could you tell us something, sir, about your interview yesterday with the Treasury Minister of Argentina?
5
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 60: He paid me a courtesy call, as nearly all these foreign dignitaries do.
Sentence 61: I had a very pleasant visit with him, and he told me that he had been discussing various matters in which both the Argentine Government and the Government of the United States are interested, that he had received the utmost cooperation from the people with whom he had to deal, that he had several other interviews to make, and several other people to see.
Sentence 62: And I told him I hoped he would have the same courteous treatment, and have the same good results which he assured me he had had up to date.
Sentence 63: That is the gist of the conversation.
Sentence 64: 5 Ramon A. Cereijo.
Sentence 65: [7.]
Sentence 66: Q. Mr. President, to get back to those reorganization plans, I understand that your Secretary of the Treasury is opposed to the transfer of the currency into--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: The Secretary of the Treasury has his views, which he is entitled to, on the control of the currency.
Sentence 68: That is one small part of that reorganization plan.
Sentence 69: The plan should not be defeated on that account.
Sentence 70: [8.]
Sentence 71: Q. Mr. President, within the past day or so the direction of the military budget appears to have turned upward again--there have been recommendations on the Hill--I wonder if you would comment on that in relation to your general policy--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 72: I think the statement of the Secretary of Defense to the Appropriations Committee fully covers the situation.
Sentence 73: 6
6
Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson appeared before the House Appropriations Committee on April 26 and stated that the Department of Defense had been engaged in a reevaluation of the country's military requirements since September 23, 1949, when President Truman had announced that there had been an atomic explosion in the Soviet Union.
Sentence 74: He urged that the Committee recommend an increase in the military budget of $350 million.
Sentence 75: Of that sum $300 million was to be used for aircraft procurement and $50 million for antisubmarine vessels.
Sentence 76: His recommendation was approved by the Committee.
Sentence 77: Q.
Sentence 78: And you support it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: And it was submitted to me for approval before it was made, and I think it is necessary or I would not have approved it.
Sentence 80: [9.]
Sentence 81: Q. Mr. President, regarding the Navy Privateer plane,
7
I wonder if the next time Russian planes buzz around our planes that the Russians' claims are likely to be true, that is, that we fired--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 82: That is a matter that the State Department has been handling, and I can't comment on it, I'm sorry.
Sentence 83: 7 See Item 86 [23].
Sentence 84: [10.]
Sentence 85: Q. Mr. President, insomuch as nominations from the White House for toplevel posts are frequently held up by the Senate confirmation quite a long while, would you recommend or approve legislation calling for approval of such within a reasonable time?
Sentence 86: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: Well now, I was a United States Senator from Missouri for 10 years.
Sentence 88: The Senate has certain rules with regard to their advice and consent power in the Constitution.
Sentence 89: I wouldn't change it.
Sentence 90: I manage to get along all right, whether they approve it or whether they don't.
Sentence 91: I think most of them will be approved.
Sentence 92: [11.]
Sentence 93: Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on the recommendation of Mr. Jesse Jones for abolition of the RFC?
8
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 94: NO comment.
Sentence 95: Mr. Jones no longer runs it.
Sentence 96: Maybe that might be the reason he made that comment.
Sentence 97: 8 As reported in the New York Times, Jesse Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation from 1933 to 1939, stated his case for terminating the Corporation in a letter to Senator J. William Fulbright, Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee.
Sentence 98: The letter pointed out that the conditions that prompted the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in the days of the depression no longer existed and that continued activity in the field put the Government in competition with private lending companies.
Sentence 99: [12.]
Sentence 100: Q. Mr. President, are you going to make another effort to get draft legislation at this session?
Sentence 101: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 102: I sent a message on the subject and I think in the Message on the State of the Union, both last January and the January before.
Sentence 103: That still stands.
Sentence 104: Q. Will you make another effort?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 105: That still stands.
Sentence 106: That still stands.
Sentence 107: That is before the Congress now and has been right along.
Sentence 108: My position hasn't changed, and I don't intend to change it.
Sentence 109: Q. Mr. Vinson,
9
chairman of the House Committee came out yesterday in favor of it.
Sentence 110: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: I am very happy.
Sentence 112: Very happy that he did.
Sentence 113: 9
Representative Carl Vinson of Georgia, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
Sentence 114: [13.]
Sentence 115: Q. Mr. President, have you got any kind of plan to hold on to Berlin in case this demonstration comes off on May 28th?
10
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 116: That is a matter on which I can't comment.
Sentence 117: 10 The East German Communists had threatened to stage a demonstration in Berlin on May 28.
Sentence 118: The demonstration was to take the form of a march on West Berlin.
Sentence 119: Q.
Sentence 120: What was the answer ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 121: I can't comment on it.
Sentence 122: Q. Could you comment on the report that we are prepared to shoot?
Sentence 123: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 124: I can't comment on it at all.
Sentence 125: [14.]
Sentence 126: Q. Mr. President, at the conclusion of this unusual press conference, will you express to the correspondents how you like it?
Sentence 127: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 128: Oh, surely.
Sentence 129: Surely I will.
Sentence 130: Q. Mr. President, in relation to that question, since this is the first conference in this room, you might know of some of the historic events which have occurred in this room, and I am wondering if you are familiar with--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: Not entirely.
Sentence 132: I am familiar with some of them, but not with all of them.
Sentence 133: Q.
Sentence 134: A historic Indian treaty, opening the West, was signed here.
Sentence 135: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 136: Lots of things happened in here.
Sentence 137: I might comment further on the reason for an effort to make it more convenient for you.
Sentence 138: If you remember, in 1945, I got an authorization to rebuild the President's offices on a permanent basis as they were meant to be built in the first place.
Sentence 139: And in those plans was a room especially for the purpose of holding press conferences.
Sentence 140: That room was equipped with radio equipment, and with a place to take pictures and everything else that would be for the convenience of the press and the news services.
Sentence 141: When we moved the shovels in there to go to work on the program, I think some discussion came about in a press conference about a cafeteria, and the Congress revoked the appropriation.
Sentence 142: Now this is the next best thing that I can think of to do to make it more convenient for you, and it certainly is more convenient for me.
Sentence 143: I can see every one of you, and when you stand up I can hear what you have to say, and I hope you can hear me equally well.
Sentence 144: And it is, of course, for your convenience that I wanted to make an experiment of this kind.
Sentence 145: I think, when we get used to it, that we may find it is necessary for me to stand down there in the middle
Sentence 146: so we can hear better, in which case that is what we will do.
Sentence 147: But I want to make this thing in such a manner that everybody will understand the questions and the answers, and get them fully.
Sentence 148: And I don't want to head off anybody's prerogatives as a member of the White House Correspondents' Association, or shut off any ability to break a leg getting to the phone if it is necessary.
Sentence 149: [Laughter] I don't think that will be necessary today.
Sentence 150: That is the only reason for the thing, and it seems to me that when we get used to the situation, and have found the flaws and corrected them, I think you are all going to like it.
Sentence 151: You know, everybody is opposed to change.
Sentence 152: We are all more or less fundamentally a little conservative about any improvement in anything with which we are familiar and which we have been doing over a period of years.
Sentence 153: You are no different from anybody else.
Sentence 154: But I believe in moving forward.
Sentence 155: That is what I am always trying to do.
Sentence 156: [15.]
Sentence 157: Q. You don't believe in too much change in certain directions, like the elections next fall, though ?
Sentence 158: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 159: Well now, that is a matter that the voters have to settle, and I am going to try and convince them that they have the best they can get.
Sentence 160: [More laughter]
Sentence 161: [16.]
Sentence 162: Q. Mr. President, do you plan to honor Baltimore by dedicating its international airport this summer?
Sentence 163: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 164: Your Governor and the mayor of Baltimore talked to me on that subject, and we are trying our best to arrange so that I can go.
Sentence 165: I want to go.
Sentence 166: If I go-of course, I can't make firm commitments this far in advance, and you understand that we have got a long, nonpolitical appearance in the next 2 weeks, and my desk may pile up so high I may not be able to make it, but I want to try to get there.
Sentence 167: I would like to come.
Sentence 168: [17.]
Sentence 169: Q. You discussed with Senator Bridges a new approach to--on bipartisan foreign policy--bringing in Republican leaders.
Sentence 170: Could you tell us how that would work?
Sentence 171: Would Democrats be present?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 172: Oh, certainly.
Sentence 173: I had a conversation on that very subject with Senator Connally and the Secretary of State this morning, and issued a statement on the subject which covers it fully.
Sentence 174: 11
Sentence 175: It is the program that was inaugurated by Cordell Hull--simply trying to carry it on.
Sentence 176: 11 See Item 96.
Sentence 177: You know, changes take place in the Government of the United States that are continuous and sometimes the successors to the people who inaugurate a plan are not entirely familiar with it.
Sentence 178: I think that is all the difficulty there is in connection with the bipartisan foreign policy.
Sentence 179: I am continuing with it just as it was started by Cordell Hull.
Sentence 180: [18.]
Sentence 181: Q. This has been a magnificent press conference, and I think what I say will be agreed to by all members of the press here present.
Sentence 182: Will you now just give us a few words to sum up your whole attitude towards this press conference ?
Sentence 183: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 184: Well, I am highly pleased myself.
Sentence 185: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 186: Then we will all go home.
Sentence 187: [Laughter ]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 188: We will all go home.
Sentence 189: The reason I am highly pleased is because I am going to be able to call all of you by your first names, as I did the first row over there in the other building.
Sentence 190: And I think maybe we will consider putting this desk or table down in the middle there, facing the chairs on all four sides, so that everybody will have a chance, and I think probably the acoustics will be better from there than it is from here.
Sentence 191: That balcony back there may make it harder to hear for those in the back.
Sentence 192: But I would like to try this thing out to its logical conclusion; and then if you all feel like you want to go back to the old conservative way of doing business, we will consider it.
Sentence 193: [Laughter]
Reporter:
Sentence 194: Thank your, Mr. President.
