THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have no special announcements to make this morning, so if you want to start off with questions, why go ahead.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: Q. Mr. President, this week a couple of major economic recommendations were made to the Congress by people outside the Government, which attracted a lot of attention.
Sentence 5: I wonder if you could give us some comment on the Baruch recommendations,
1
and Mr. Hoover's recommendations?
2
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 6: Well, most of Mr. Baruch's recommendations I was pleased to read, most of them.
Sentence 7: I have already made a specific recommendation to the Congress, and so far as Mr. Baruch's recommendations are in line with that recommendation, I am for what he said.
Sentence 8: I am not for Mr. Hoover's recommendations.
Sentence 9: 1
On January 19 Bernard Baruch proposed an 11-point program which included postponement of tax reduction for 2 years; a world recovery program based on providing a market in the United States for raw materials from all nations; and an all-out production effort in the United States coupled with wartime controls on food, prices, wages, and profits.
Sentence 10: 2
On January 22 former President Herbert Hoover was reported in the press as having challenged the administration's handling of the European recovery program, and as having urged that Congress limit appropriations for world relief and rehabilitation to $4 billion for the 15 months beginning April 1, 1948.
Sentence 11: [2.]
Sentence 12: Q. There is another economic recommendation that was made by President Wilson of General Motors, that was along the line of extending the workweek from 40 to 45 hours, as a compromise.
Sentence 13: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 14: I think Mr. Wilson is living in 1890, I am sorry to say.
Sentence 15: There is another Mr. Wilson who doesn't believe that.
Sentence 16: He is the president of the General Electric Company.
Sentence 17: [3.]

Adm. Aaron Stanton Merrill.
Sentence 20: Q.
Sentence 21: What was the name that he asked?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 22: Admiral Merrill.
Sentence 23: I have never heard of him.
Sentence 24: Q.
Sentence 25: He is either CAA or CAB.
Sentence 26: [Laughter ]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 27: He is not being considered by me.
Sentence 28: Q. Are there any considerations being given to the vacancies--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 29: I have several men under consideration.
Sentence 30: I have asked several men to serve, and I have not yet succeeded in getting one to say yes.
Sentence 31: And the man whom I did get to say yes, the Congress didn't see fit to allow to serve.
Sentence 32: And that brought the salary proposition into it, which had nothing whatever to do with the proposition at all.
Sentence 33: I was merely endeavoring to find the man to do the job for me temporarily to get the thing going again.
Sentence 34: And I found out afterwards that General Kuter's salary was greater than the one that was paid by the chairmanship in the CAA.
Sentence 35: But they would have saved $10,000 anyway, because Kuter still draws his pay.
Sentence 36: Q. Well, Mr. President, in view of the trouble you have had filling these different positions, do you think the pay of high-ranking jobs should be increased?
Sentence 37: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: I think so, yes.
Sentence 39: I think they should be paid commensurate with their responsibilities.
Sentence 40: I have always said that.
Sentence 41: I think I had more to do with the raising of the pay of the Congress than anybody here.
Sentence 42: Q.
Sentence 43: Can you tell us who declined the proffers-these posts?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: No, I shall not.
Sentence 45: [4.]
Sentence 46: Q. Mr. President, could you name some of the specific recommendations of Mr. Baruch which you endorse?
Sentence 47: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 48: Just read it and compare it with my program which I took down, in the Message on the State of the Union.
Sentence 49: You can do it yourself.
Sentence 50: I am not working for newspapers!
Sentence 51: [Laughter]
Sentence 52: [5.]
Sentence 53: Q. Mr. President, will you reappoint Mr. Szymczak of the Federal Reserve Board?

Sentence 55: I will make an announcement on that at a later date.
Sentence 56: [6.]
Sentence 57: Q. Mr. President, do you see any sign, or have any hope, that Mr. Wallace will follow the example of Mr. Whitney?
Sentence 58: 1
Sentence 59: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 60: I have no comment on that.
Sentence 61: 1 On January 17 Alexander F. Whitney, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, resigned as vice chairman of the Progressive Citizens of America.
Sentence 62: [7.]

Sentence 67: [8.]
Sentence 68: Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on the announced retirement of your old friend Mackenzie King of Canada?
Sentence 69: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: I am very sorry to see the Prime Minister of Canada retire at this time, although he has given 20 of the best years of his life to Canada as Prime Minister, and in the meantime I think was still a Member of Parliament.
Sentence 71: He has been in public life a long time.
Sentence 72: He is 73 years old, but in very good physical condition.
Sentence 73: I had a very pleasant visit with him when I was in Canada, and he has visited here on several occasions.
Sentence 74: And Canada is really suffering a loss in a real public servant.
Sentence 75: I am a very great admirer of Mackenzie King.
Sentence 76: [9.]
Sentence 77: Q. Mr. President, if we could go back a second to the Hoover recommendations, specifically he asked for a cut in the amount of funds for 15 months and then limitation of 15 months--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: I just don't approve of Mr. Hoover's statement.
Sentence 79: That is as far as I care to go.
Sentence 80: Wouldn't go into details, because it speaks for itself.
Sentence 81: [10.]
Sentence 82: Q. Mr. President, the St. Lawrence measure also comes up on the Senate floor Monday.
Sentence 83: Do you still plan to send a message or letter?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: Probably won't require a message.

Sentence 94: [Laughter] Have you any idea when there will be any announcement?
Sentence 95: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: No, I haven't the slightest notion.
Sentence 97: Q. Will there be any?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 98: Oh, eventually of course there will be one before the Democratic convention meets in Philadelphia, but I don't see that there is any hurry about any announcement.
Sentence 99: [Laughter]
Q. Just one, Mr. President?
Sentence 100: Q.
Sentence 101: I notice you said one.
Sentence 102: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 103: I didn't say that--everybody in the United States has a right to be a candidate for President if he wants to be, on either party ticket.
Sentence 104: Q. Or a third party ticket?
Sentence 105: THE PRESIDENT, Or a third party ticket.
Sentence 106: He would have a better chance, however, if he were on the ticket of the other old parties.
Sentence 107: Q. Mr. President, do you imply that some don't have to pick a ticket until pretty late in the day?
Sentence 108: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 109: Some of them don't--they vacillate.
Sentence 110: Could name a great many who are newcomers to both parties.
Sentence 111: But some of them, of course, will try to get back on the bandwagon and in the parties where they really belong.
Sentence 112: Q. Anyone particularly in mind, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
