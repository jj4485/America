Sentence 38: The administration is for the program that was sent to the Congress and supported by Mr. Forrestal.

Sentence 55: Could you comment on that, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 56: Unification eventually will work.
Sentence 57: It's like every other new organization in the Government, it has to become implemented, and people have to become accustomed to it and used to it.

Q. Is the picture rosy or gray?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: The picture was all right.
Sentence 109: [13.]
Sentence 110: Miss May,1 you asked me about that balcony.
Sentence 111: I have some pictures here that are right interesting, on the balcony, which show the reasons that I had in view.
Sentence 112: The proper reasons have never been attributed to me.
Sentence 113: They thought it was a selfish reason that I had.
Sentence 114: But that portico on the porch was designed by Thomas Jefferson.
Sentence 115: It was first built with very narrow, spindly, wooden columns; and in 1855 they finally began to carry out the Jefferson program.
Sentence 116: And they had the same row over it that they had over this improvement of mine.
Sentence 117: [Laughter]
1 Mrs. May Craig of the Portland (Maine) Press Herald.
Sentence 118: But, in order to use that porch in the summertime, it was necessary to have these awnings--I don't know whether you can all see this or not--[holding up some photographs of the south portico]--but these awnings have to be replaced once a year, at a cost of about $700 a year; and we tried concealing them and everything else, but they absolutely ruined the proportions of the columns.
Sentence 119: When that porch was designed, it was intended to have a balcony, because Jefferson had designed several down in the University of Virginia, which were finally completed with a balcony.
Sentence 120: And the idea in putting the balcony up there was to give the pillars the proper proportions, without having them cut in two in the middle by the awnings.
Sentence 121: You know, that is a combination Ionic and Corinthian column there.
Sentence 122: It isn't a pure Ionic column.
Sentence 123: They have certain proportions in connection with the height as to diameter, and when you cut them in two in the middle, there is an obstruction, as those awnings were.
Sentence 124: It ruins the looks and proportions of the columns.
Sentence 125: You can see how the portico goes back in there.
Sentence 126: If you come down in the street and take a look at it, you can see that it adds a great deal to the looks of the White House, and makes the south facade look as it was intended to look in the first place.
Sentence 127: That's the only reason it was done.
Sentence 128: I never expect to use the balcony, because it's too prominent.
Sentence 129: I might just as well sit down here in the backyard next to the iron fence.
Sentence 130: [Laughter] It was only put there to improve the architectural appearance of the White House in the south, and we had to get rid of those dirty awnings which were a continued expense to the White House upkeep.
Sentence 131: [14.]
Sentence 132: Q. Mr. President, have you had any indication from some of the Southern States of a back-to-Truman movement?
Sentence 133: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 134: There were a great many who never left Truman.
Sentence 135: [Laughter]
Sentence 136: [15.]
Sentence 137: Q. Well, Mr. President, why didn't you tell us this in the beginning, about the balcony?
Sentence 138: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 139: I did try to tell you, but the people who were so interested in finding fault with it didn't want to find the facts.
Sentence 140: I tried my best to tell you.
Sentence 141: Q. Mr. President, then there is--this question may sound impertinent--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 142: No, it isn't--no, it isn't.
Sentence 143: Go ahead.
Sentence 144: Q. Are you well documented on that statement that Jefferson intended it?
Sentence 145: Is that.--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 146: Yes, I know that Jefferson designed the porch.
Sentence 147: Q.
Sentence 148: That is something that somebody is going to hammer you on.
Sentence 149: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: That porch was designed by Jefferson.
Sentence 151: It had a balcony on it.
Sentence 152: Whether he designed it or not, I don't know, but his design came from these southern mansions at that time, which always had a portico.
Sentence 153: Q. Mr. President, do you feel the Fine Arts Commission sort of misled you--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 154: No, I don't.
Sentence 155: I think the Fine Arts Commission is absolutely correct.
Sentence 156: You will find architects all over the country are in the same mood--of the same opinion as the Fine Arts Commission were in the first place.
Sentence 157: They got scared when they commenced firing bricks at them.
Sentence 158: I don't scare easily.
Sentence 159: [Laughter]
Sentence 160: [16.]
Sentence 161: Q. Mr. President, does that have any political significance also?
Sentence 162: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 163: If you want to give it any, Miss May.
Sentence 164: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 165: You say you are not going to use the balcony?
Sentence 166: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: Of course, I won't get to use it.
Sentence 168: I don't have time to--for any pleasures.
Sentence 169: I work all the time.
Sentence 170: I get up at 5 o'clock in the morning, and am sitting at the desk at 6, and I never leave that desk until it's late at night, unless I have to go out somewhere and make a speech, as I did at the Gridiron dinner the other night.
Sentence 171: Q.
Sentence 172: Do you anticipate you might need it during the next 4 years?
Sentence 173: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 174: I anticipate using it during the next 4 years, if I get a chance to use it, that is.
Sentence 175: I'll be there to use it, don't worry about that.
Sentence 176: Q.
Sentence 177: That's about as near as you have come--[ Laughter ]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 178: What do you mean?
Sentence 179: Q.
Sentence 180: I mean you are saying definitely that you are going to run--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 181: Oh no, I made that announcement some time ago.
Sentence 182: That announcement has been made a long time ago.
Sentence 183: Q.
Sentence 184: That's about as near as you have come to predicting victory--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 185: No, it isn't.
Sentence 186: I predicted victory here the other day.
Sentence 187: You just didn't get it.
Sentence 188: But I shall never be downhearted at all.
Sentence 189: [17.]
Sentence 190: Q. Mr. President, they have just abolished the death penalty in England.
Sentence 191: I wondered whether you had any general views on that subject?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 192: I have no comment on that.
Sentence 193: [18.]
Sentence 194: Q. Mr. President, Life magazine said you were going to nominate General Eisenhower.
Sentence 195: Any comment on that?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 196: Life magazine knows a lot of things that I don't know, most of them not facts.
Sentence 197: Q. Also said, Mr. President, that you were going to send General Eisenhower to see Stalin.
Sentence 198: Is that true?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 199: Well, that is something I don't know, either.
Sentence 200: I never heard of it before.
Sentence 201: I don't intend to do it, if that's the proper answer to give you.
Sentence 202: General Eisenhower is going up and run a university.
Sentence 203: Q.
Sentence 204: Any deep political significance in the fact that George Allen and Eisenhower are down in Georgia playing golf?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 205: You will have to ask them.
Sentence 206: I can't answer that.
Sentence 207: They have a right to attend to their own business, the same as I have mine; only I don't get to attend to mine without interference.
Sentence 208: [Laughter]
Q. Do you think that there is any business between George Allen and--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 209: No--I only know that they are great friends, that Eisenhower and George Allen are congenial.
Sentence 210: They like to be in each other's company.
Sentence 211: And I like them both, too, and like to be in their company.
Sentence 212: Q. Mr. President, was there any significance in Eisenhower's and Mr. Allen's conference?
Sentence 213: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 214: Not that I know of.
Sentence 215: The best thing to do would be to ask them.
Sentence 216: Q.
Sentence 217: I thought maybe you might have said something--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 218: No.
Sentence 219: I think the best thing to do is to ask them.
Sentence 220: [19.]
Sentence 221: Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on the Italian elections next Sunday?
Sentence 222: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 227: Thank you, sir.
Sentence 228: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 229: You're welcome.
