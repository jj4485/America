Sentence 1: 1860 Address Cooper Union New York City

Mr. President and fellow citizens of New York:
-
The facts with which I shall deal this evening are mainly old and familiar; nor is there anything new in the general use I shall make of them.
Sentence 2: If there shall be any novelty, it will be in the mode of presenting the facts, and the inferences and observations following that presentation.
Sentence 3: In his speech last autumn, at Columbus, Ohio, as reported in "The New-York Times," Senator Douglas said:
"Our fathers, when they framed the Government under which we live, understood this question just as well, and even better, than we do now.
Sentence 4: "
I fully indorse this, and I adopt it as a text for this discourse.
Sentence 5: I so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting point for a discussion between Republicans and that wing of the Democracy headed by Senator Douglas.
Sentence 6: It simply leaves the inquiry: "What was the understanding those fathers had of the question mentioned?"
What is the frame of government under which we live?
Sentence 7: The answer must be: "The Constitution of the United States."
Sentence 8: That Constitution consists of the original, framed in 1787, (and under which the present government first went into operation,) and twelve subsequently framed amendments, the first ten of which were framed in 1789.
Sentence 9: Who were our fathers that framed the Constitution?
Sentence 10: I suppose the "thirty-nine" who signed the original instrument may be fairly called our fathers who framed that part of the present Government.
Sentence 11: It is almost exactly true to say they framed it, and it is altogether true to say they fairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that time.
Sentence 12: Their names, being familiar to nearly all, and accessible to quite all, need not now be repeated.
Sentence 13: I take these "thirty-nine," for the present, as being "our fathers who framed the Government under which we live.
Sentence 14: "
What is the question which, according to the text, those fathers understood "just as well, and even better than we do now?"
It is this: Does the proper division of local from federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, forbid our
Federal Government
to control as to slavery in
our Federal Territories
?
Sentence 15: Upon this, Senator Douglas holds the affirmative, and Republicans the negative.
Sentence 16: This affirmation and denial form an issue; and this issue - this question - is precisely what the text declares our fathers understood "better than we.
Sentence 17: "
Let us now inquire whether the "thirty-nine," or any of them, ever acted upon this question; and if they did, how they acted upon it - how they expressed that better understanding?
Sentence 18: In 1784, three years before the Constitution - the United States then owning the Northwestern Territory, and no other, the Congress of the Confederation had before them the question of prohibiting slavery in that Territory; and four of the "thirty-nine" who afterward framed the Constitution, were in that Congress, and voted on that question.
Sentence 19: Of these, Roger Sherman, Thomas Mifflin, and Hugh Williamson voted for the prohibition, thus showing that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from federal authority, nor anything else, properly forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in federal territory.
Sentence 20: The other of the four - James M'Henry - voted against the prohibition, showing that, for some cause, he thought it improper to vote for it.
Sentence 21: In 1787, still before the Constitution, but while the Convention was in session framing it, and while the Northwestern Territory still was the only territory owned by the United States, the same question of prohibiting slavery in the territory again came before the Congress of the Confederation; and two more of the "thirty-nine" who afterward signed the Constitution, were in that Congress, and voted on the question.
Sentence 22: They were William Blount and William Few; and they both voted for the prohibition - thus showing that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from federal authority, nor anything else, properly forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory.
Sentence 23: This time the prohibition became a law, being part of what is now well known as the Ordinance of '87.
Sentence 24: The question of federal control of slavery in the territories, seems not to have been directly before the Convention which framed the original Constitution; and hence it is not recorded that the "thirty-nine," or any of them, while engaged on that instrument, expressed any opinion on that precise question.
Sentence 25: In 1789, by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution, an act was passed to enforce the Ordinance of '87, including the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory.
Sentence 26: The bill for this act was reported by one of the "thirty-nine," Thomas Fitzsimmons, then a member of the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.
Sentence 27: It went through all its stages without a word of opposition, and finally passed both branches without yeas and nays, which is equivalent to a unanimous passage.
Sentence 28: In this Congress there were sixteen of the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution.
Sentence 29: They were John Langdon, Nicholas Gilman, Wm.
Sentence 30: S. Johnson, Roger Sherman, Robert Morris, Thos.
Sentence 31: Fitzsimmons, William Few, Abraham Baldwin, Rufus King, William Paterson, George Clymer, Richard Bassett, George Read, Pierce Butler, Daniel Carroll, James Madison.
Sentence 32: This shows that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, properly forbade Congress to prohibit slavery in the federal territory; else both their fidelity to correct principle, and their oath to support the Constitution, would have constrained them to oppose the prohibition.
Sentence 33: Again, George Washington, another of the "thirty-nine," was then President of the United States, and, as such approved and signed the bill; thus completing its validity as a law, and thus showing that, in his understanding, no line dividing local from federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government, to control as to slavery in federal territory.
Sentence 34: No great while after the adoption of the original Constitution, North Carolina ceded to the Federal Government the country now constituting the State of Tennessee; and a few years later Georgia ceded that which now constitutes the States of Mississippi and Alabama.
Sentence 35: In both deeds of cession it was made a condition by the ceding States that the Federal Government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded territory.
Sentence 36: Besides this, slavery was then actually in the ceded country.
Sentence 37: Under these circumstances, Congress, on taking charge of these countries, did not absolutely prohibit slavery within them.
Sentence 38: But they did interfere with it - take control of it - even there, to a certain extent.
Sentence 39: In 1798, Congress organized the Territory of Mississippi.
Sentence 40: In the act of organization, they prohibited the bringing of slaves into the Territory, from any place without the United States, by fine, and giving freedom to slaves so bought.
Sentence 41: This act passed both branches of Congress without yeas and nays.
Sentence 42: In that Congress were three of the "thirty-nine" who framed the original Constitution.
Sentence 43: They were John Langdon, George Read and Abraham Baldwin.
Sentence 44: They all, probably, voted for it.
Sentence 45: Certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon record, if, in their understanding, any line dividing local from federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, properly forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in federal territory.
Sentence 46: In 1803, the Federal Government purchased the Louisiana country.
Sentence 47: Our former territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own States; but this Louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation.
Sentence 48: In 1804, Congress gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitutes the State of Louisiana.
Sentence 49: New Orleans, lying within that part, was an old and comparatively large city.
Sentence 50: There were other considerable towns and settlements, and slavery was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with the people.
Sentence 51: Congress did not, in the Territorial Act, prohibit slavery; but they did interfere with it - take control of it - in a more marked and extensive way than they did in the case of Mississippi.
Sentence 52: The substance of the provision therein made, in relation to slaves, was:
First.
Sentence 53: That no slave should be imported into the territory from foreign parts.
Sentence 54: Second.
Sentence 55: That no slave should be carried into it who had been imported into the United States since the first day of May, 1798.
Sentence 56: Third.
Sentence 57: That no slave should be carried into it, except by the owner, and for his own use as a settler; the penalty in all the cases being a fine upon the violator of the law, and freedom to the slave.
Sentence 58: This act also was passed without yeas and nays.
Sentence 59: In the Congress which passed it, there were two of the "thirty-nine."
Sentence 60: They were Abraham Baldwin and Jonathan Dayton.
Sentence 61: As stated in the case of Mississippi, it is probable they both voted for it.
Sentence 62: They would not have allowed it to pass without recording their opposition to it, if, in their understanding, it violated either the line properly dividing local from federal authority, or any provision of the Constitution.
Sentence 63: In 1819-20, came and passed the Missouri question.
Sentence 64: Many votes were taken, by yeas and nays, in both branches of Congress, upon the various phases of the general question.
Sentence 65: Two of the "thirty-nine" - Rufus King and Charles Pinckney - were members of that Congress.
Sentence 66: Mr. King steadily voted for slavery prohibition and against all compromises, while Mr. Pinckney as steadily voted against slavery prohibition and against all compromises.
Sentence 67: By this, Mr. King showed that, in his understanding, no line dividing local from federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, was violated by Congress prohibiting slavery in federal territory; while Mr. Pinckney, by his votes, showed that, in his understanding, there was some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case.
Sentence 68: The cases I have mentioned are the only acts of the "thirty-nine," or of any of them, upon the direct issue, which I have been able to discover.
Sentence 69: To enumerate the persons who thus acted, as being four in 1784, two in 1787, seventeen in 1789, three in 1798, two in 1804, and two in 1819-20 - there would be thirty of them.
Sentence 70: But this would be counting John Langdon, Roger Sherman, William Few, Rufus King, and George Read each twice, and Abraham Baldwin, three times.
Sentence 71: The true number of those of the "thirty-nine" whom I have shown to have acted upon the question, which, by the text, they understood better than we, is twenty-three, leaving sixteen not shown to have acted upon it in any way.
Sentence 72: Here, then, we have twenty-three out of our thirty-nine fathers "who framed the government under which we live," who have, upon their official responsibility and their corporal oaths, acted upon the very question which the text affirms they "understood just as well, and even better than we do now;" and twenty-one of them - a clear majority of the whole "thirty-nine" - so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety and willful perjury, if, in their understanding, any proper division between local and federal authority, or anything in the Constitution they had made themselves, and sworn to support, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the federal territories.
Sentence 73: Thus the twenty-one acted; and, as actions speak louder than words, so actions, under such responsibility, speak still louder.
Sentence 74: Two of the twenty-three voted against Congressional prohibition of slavery in the federal territories, in the instances in which they acted upon the question.
Sentence 75: But for what reasons they so voted is not known.
Sentence 76: They may have done so because they thought a proper division of local from federal authority, or some provision or principle of the Constitution, stood in the way; or they may, without any such question, have voted against the prohibition, on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds of expediency.
Sentence 77: No one who has sworn to support the Constitution can conscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional measure, however expedient he may think it; but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deems constitutional, if, at the same time, he deems it inexpedient.
Sentence 78: It, therefore, would be unsafe to set down even the two who voted against the prohibition, as having done so because, in their understanding, any proper division of local from federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in federal territory.
Sentence 79: The remaining sixteen of the "thirty-nine," so far as I have discovered, have left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of federal control of slavery in the federal territories.
Sentence 80: But there is much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appeared different from that of their twenty-three compeers, had it been manifested at all.
Sentence 81: For the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text, I have purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any person, however distinguished, other than the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution; and, for the same reason, I have also omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any of the "thirty-nine" even, on any other phase of the general question of slavery.
Sentence 82: If we should look into their acts and declarations on those other phases, as the foreign slave trade, and the morality and policy of slavery generally, it would appear to us that on the direct question of federal control of slavery in federal territories, the sixteen, if they had acted at all, would probably have acted just as the twenty-three did.
Sentence 83: Among that sixteen were several of the most noted anti-slavery men of those times - as Dr. Franklin, Alexander Hamilton and Gouverneur Morris - while there was not one now known to have been otherwise, unless it may be John Rutledge, of South Carolina.
Sentence 84: The sum of the whole is, that of our thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution, twenty-one - a clear majority of the whole - certainly understood that no proper division of local from federal authority, nor any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control slavery in the federal territories; while all the rest probably had the same understanding.
Sentence 85: Such, unquestionably, was the understanding of our fathers who framed the original Constitution; and the text affirms that they understood the question "better than we.
Sentence 86: "
But, so far, I have been considering the understanding of the question manifested by the framers of the original Constitution.
Sentence 87: In and by the original instrument, a mode was provided for amending it; and, as I have already stated, the present frame of "the Government under which we live" consists of that original, and twelve amendatory articles framed and adopted since.
Sentence 88: Those who now insist that federal control of slavery in federal territories violates the Constitution, point us to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates; and, as I understand, that all fix upon provisions in these amendatory articles, and not in the original instrument.
Sentence 89: The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott case, plant themselves upon the fifth amendment, which provides that no person shall be deprived of "life, liberty or property without due process of law;" while Senator Douglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth amendment, providing that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution" "are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
Sentence 90: Now, it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution - the identical Congress which passed the act already mentioned, enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory.
Sentence 91: Not only was it the same Congress, but they were the identical, same individual men who, at the same session, and at the same time within the session, had under consideration, and in progress toward maturity, these Constitutional amendments, and this act prohibiting slavery in all the territory the nation then owned.
Sentence 92: The Constitutional amendments were introduced before, and passed after the act enforcing the Ordinance of '87; so that, during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the Ordinance, the Constitutional amendments were also pending.
Sentence 93: The seventy-six members of that Congress, including sixteen of the framers of the original Constitution, as before stated, were pre- eminently our fathers who framed that part of "the Government under which we live," which is now claimed as forbidding the Federal Government to control slavery in the federal territories.
Sentence 94: Is it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the two things which that Congress deliberately framed, and carried to maturity at the same time, are absolutely inconsistent with each other?
Sentence 95: And does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the other affirmation from the same mouth, that those who did the two things, alleged to be inconsistent, understood whether they really were inconsistent better than we - better than he who affirms that they are inconsistent?
Sentence 96: It is surely safe to assume that the thirty-nine framers of the original Constitution, and the seventy-six members of the Congress which framed the amendments thereto, taken together, do certainly include those who may be fairly called "our fathers who framed the Government under which we live."
Sentence 97: And so assuming, I defy any man to show that any one of them ever, in his whole life, declared that, in his understanding, any proper division of local from federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the federal territories.
Sentence 98: I go a step further.
Sentence 99: I defy any one to show that any living man in the whole world ever did, prior to the beginning of the present century, (and I might almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century,) declare that, in his understanding, any proper division of local from federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the federal territories.
Sentence 100: To those who now so declare, I give, not only "our fathers who framed the Government under which we live," but with them all other living men within the century in which it was framed, among whom to search, and they shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them.
Sentence 101: Now, and here, let me guard a little against being misunderstood.
Sentence 102: I do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did.
Sentence 103: To do so, would be to discard all the lights of current experience - to reject all progress - all improvement.
Sentence 104: What I do say is, that if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case, we should do so upon evidence so conclusive, and argument so clear, that even their great authority, fairly considered and weighed, cannot stand; and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question better than we.
Sentence 105: If any man at this day sincerely believes that a proper division of local from federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the federal territories, he is right to say so, and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can.
Sentence 106: But he has no right to mislead others, who have less access to history, and less leisure to study it, into the false belief that "our fathers who framed the Government under which we live" were of the same opinion - thus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument.
Sentence 107: If any man at this day sincerely believes "our fathers who framed the Government under which we live," used and applied principles, in other cases, which ought to have led them to understand that a proper division of local from federal authority or some part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the federal territories, he is right to say so.
Sentence 108: But he should, at the same time, brave the responsibility of declaring that, in his opinion, he understands their principles better than they did themselves; and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by asserting that they "understood the question just as well, and even better, than we do now."
Sentence 109: But enough!
Sentence 110: Let all who believe that "our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live, understood this question just as well, and even better, than we do now," speak as they spoke, and act as they acted upon it.
Sentence 111: This is all Republicans ask - all Republicans desire - in relation to slavery.
Sentence 112: As those fathers marked it, so let it be again marked, as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only because of and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity.
Sentence 113: Let all the guarantees those fathers gave it, be, not grudgingly, but fully and fairly, maintained.
Sentence 114: For this Republicans contend, and with this, so far as I know or believe, they will be content.
Sentence 115: And now, if they would listen - as I suppose they will not - I would address a few words to the Southern people.
Sentence 116: I would say to them: - You consider yourselves a reasonable and a just people; and I consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other people.
Sentence 117: Still, when you speak of us Republicans, you do so only to denounce us a reptiles, or, at the best, as no better than outlaws.
Sentence 118: You will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to "Black Republicans."
Sentence 119: In all your contentions with one another, each of you deems an unconditional condemnation of "Black Republicanism" as the first thing to be attended to.
Sentence 120: Indeed, such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite - license, so to speak - among you to be admitted or permitted to speak at all.
Sentence 121: Now, can you, or not, be prevailed upon to pause and to consider whether this is quite just to us, or even to yourselves?
Sentence 122: Bring forward your charges and specifications, and then be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify.
Sentence 123: You say we are sectional.
Sentence 124: We deny it.
Sentence 125: That makes an issue; and the burden of proof is upon you.
Sentence 126: You produce your proof; and what is it?
Sentence 127: Why, that our party has no existence in your section - gets no votes in your section.
Sentence 128: The fact is substantially true; but does it prove the issue?
Sentence 129: If it does, then in case we should, without change of principle, begin to get votes in your section, we should thereby cease to be sectional.
Sentence 130: You cannot escape this conclusion; and yet, are you willing to abide by it?
Sentence 131: If you are, you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional, for we shall get votes in your section this very year.
Sentence 132: You will then begin to discover, as the truth plainly is, that your proof does not touch the issue.
Sentence 133: The fact that we get no votes in your section, is a fact of your making, and not of ours.
Sentence 134: And if there be fault in that fact, that fault is primarily yours, and remains until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice.
Sentence 135: If we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice, the fault is ours; but this brings you to where you ought to have started - to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle.
Sentence 136: If our principle, put in practice, would wrong your section for the benefit of ours, or for any other object, then our principle, and we with it, are sectional, and are justly opposed and denounced as such.
Sentence 137: Meet us, then, on the question of whether our principle, put in practice, would wrong your section; and so meet it as if it were possible that something may be said on our side.
Sentence 138: Do you accept the challenge?
Sentence 139: No!
Sentence 140: Then you really believe that the principle which "our fathers who framed the Government under which we live" thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and indorse it again and again, upon their official oaths, is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moment's consideration.
Sentence 141: Some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by Washington in his Farewell Address.
Sentence 142: Less than eight years before Washington gave that warning, he had, as President of the United States, approved and signed an act of Congress, enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory, which act embodied the policy of the Government upon that subject up to and at the very moment he penned that warning; and about one year after he penned it, he wrote LaFayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure, expressing in the same connection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free States.
Sentence 143: Bearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject, is that warning a weapon in your hands against us, or in our hands against you?
Sentence 144: Could Washington himself speak, would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon you who repudiate it?
Sentence 145: We respect that warning of Washington, and we commend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right application of it.
Sentence 146: But you say you are conservative - eminently conservative - while we are revolutionary, destructive, or something of the sort.
Sentence 147: What is conservatism?
Sentence 148: Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?
Sentence 149: We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by "our fathers who framed the Government under which we live;" while you with one accord reject, and scout, and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new.
Sentence 150: True, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be.
Sentence 151: You are divided on new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers.
Sentence 152: Some of you are for reviving the foreign slave trade; some for a Congressional Slave-Code for the Territories; some for Congress forbidding the Territories to prohibit Slavery within their limits; some for maintaining Slavery in the Territories through the judiciary; some for the "gur-reat pur-rinciple" that "if one man would enslave another, no third man should object," fantastically called "Popular Sovereignty;" but never a man among you is in favor of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territories, according to the practice of "our fathers who framed the Government under which we live."
Sentence 153: Not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our Government originated.
Sentence 154: Consider, then, whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves, and your charge or destructiveness against us, are based on the most clear and stable foundations.
Sentence 155: Again, you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it formerly was.
Sentence 156: We deny it.
Sentence 157: We admit that it is more prominent, but we deny that we made it so.
Sentence 158: It was not we, but you, who discarded the old policy of the fathers.
Sentence 159: We resisted, and still resist, your innovation; and thence comes the greater prominence of the question.
Sentence 160: Would you have that question reduced to its former proportions?
Sentence 161: Go back to that old policy.
Sentence 162: What has been will be again, under the same conditions.
Sentence 163: If you would have the peace of the old times, readopt the precepts and policy of the old times.
Sentence 164: You charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves.
Sentence 165: We deny it; and what is your proof?
Sentence 166: Harper's Ferry!
Sentence 167: John Brown!!
Sentence 168: John Brown was no Republican; and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in his Harper's Ferry enterprise.
Sentence 169: If any member of our party is guilty in that matter, you know it or you do not know it.
Sentence 170: If you do know it, you are inexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact.
Sentence 171: If you do not know it, you are inexcusable for asserting it, and especially for persisting in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof.
Sentence 172: You need to be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true, is simply malicious slander.
Sentence 173: Some of you admit that no Republican designedly aided or encouraged the Harper's Ferry affair, but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results.
Sentence 174: We do not believe it.
Sentence 175: We know we hold to no doctrine, and make no declaration, which were not held to and made by "our fathers who framed the Government under which we live."
Sentence 176: You never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair.
Sentence 177: When it occurred, some important State elections were near at hand, and you were in evident glee with the belief that, by charging the blame upon us, you could get an advantage of us in those elections.
Sentence 178: The elections came, and your expectations were not quite fulfilled.
Sentence 179: Every Republican man knew that, as to himself at least, your charge was a slander, and he was not much inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor.
Sentence 180: Republican doctrines and declarations are accompanied with a continual protest against any interference whatever with your slaves, or with you about your slaves.
Sentence 181: Surely, this does not encourage them to revolt.
Sentence 182: True, we do, in common with "our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live," declare our belief that slavery is wrong; but the slaves do not hear us declare even this.
Sentence 183: For anything we say or do, the slaves would scarcely know there is a Republican party.
Sentence 184: I believe they would not, in fact, generally know it but for your misrepresentations of us, in their hearing.
Sentence 185: In your political contests among yourselves, each faction charges the other with sympathy with Black Republicanism; and then, to give point to the charge, defines Black Republicanism to simply be insurrection, blood and thunder among the slaves.
Sentence 186: Slave insurrections are no more common now than they were before the Republican party was organized.
Sentence 187: What induced the Southampton insurrection, twenty-eight years ago, in which, at least three times as many lives were lost as at Harper's Ferry?
Sentence 188: You can scarcely stretch your very elastic fancy to the conclusion that Southampton was "got up by Black Republicanism."
Sentence 189: In the present state of things in the United States, I do not think a general, or even a very extensive slave insurrection is possible.
Sentence 190: The indispensable concert of action cannot be attained.
Sentence 191: The slaves have no means of rapid communication; nor can incendiary freemen, black or white, supply it.
Sentence 192: The explosive materials are everywhere in parcels; but there neither are, nor can be supplied, the indispensable connecting trains.
Sentence 193: Much is said by Southern people about the affection of slaves for their masters and mistresses; and a part of it, at least, is true.
Sentence 194: A plot for an uprising could scarcely be devised and communicated to twenty individuals before some one of them, to save the life of a favorite master or mistress, would divulge it.
Sentence 195: This is the rule; and the slave revolution in Hayti was not an exception to it, but a case occurring under peculiar circumstances.
Sentence 196: The gunpowder plot of British history, though not connected with slaves, was more in point.
Sentence 197: In that case, only about twenty were admitted to the secret; and yet one of them, in his anxiety to save a friend, betrayed the plot to that friend, and, by consequence, averted the calamity.
Sentence 198: Occasional poisonings from the kitchen, and open or stealthy assassinations in the field, and local revolts extending to a score or so, will continue to occur as the natural results of slavery; but no general insurrection of slaves, as I think, can happen in this country for a long time.
Sentence 199: Whoever much fears, or much hopes for such an event, will be alike disappointed.
Sentence 200: In the language of Mr. Jefferson, uttered many years ago, "It is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation, and deportation, peaceably, and in such slow degrees, as that the evil will wear off insensibly; and their places be,
pari passu
, filled up by free white laborers.
Sentence 201: If, on the contrary, it is left to force itself on, human nature must shudder at the prospect held up.
Sentence 202: "
Mr. Jefferson did not mean to say, nor do I, that the power of emancipation is in the Federal Government.
Sentence 203: He spoke of Virginia; and, as to the power of emancipation, I speak of the slaveholding States only.
Sentence 204: The Federal Government, however, as we insist, has the power of restraining the extension of the institution - the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any American soil which is now free from slavery.
Sentence 205: John Brown's effort was peculiar.
Sentence 206: It was not a slave insurrection.
Sentence 207: It was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves, in which the slaves refused to participate.
Sentence 208: In fact, it was so absurd that the slaves, with all their ignorance, saw plainly enough it could not succeed.
Sentence 209: That affair, in its philosophy, corresponds with the many attempts, related in history, at the assassination of kings and emperors.
Sentence 210: An enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by Heaven to liberate them.
Sentence 211: He ventures the attempt, which ends in little else than his own execution.
Sentence 212: Orsini's attempt on Louis Napoleon, and John Brown's attempt at Harper's Ferry were, in their philosophy, precisely the same.
Sentence 213: The eagerness to cast blame on old England in the one case, and on New England in the other, does not disprove the sameness of the two things.
Sentence 214: And how much would it avail you, if you could, by the use of John Brown, Helper's Book, and the like, break up the Republican organization?
Sentence 215: Human action can be modified to some extent, but human nature cannot be changed.
Sentence 216: There is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation, which cast at least a million and a half of votes.
Sentence 217: You cannot destroy that judgment and feeling - that sentiment - by breaking up the political organization which rallies around it.
Sentence 218: You can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire; but if you could, how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot-box, into some other channel?
Sentence 219: What would that other channel probably be?
Sentence 220: Would the number of John Browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation?
Sentence 221: But you will break up the Union rather than submit to a denial of your Constitutional rights.
Sentence 222: That has a somewhat reckless sound; but it would be palliated, if not fully justified, were we proposing, by the mere force of numbers, to deprive you of some right, plainly written down in the Constitution.
Sentence 223: But we are proposing no such thing.
Sentence 224: When you make these declarations, you have a specific and well-understood allusion to an assumed Constitutional right of yours, to take slaves into the federal territories, and to hold them there as property.
Sentence 225: But no such right is specifically written in the Constitution.
Sentence 226: That instrument is literally silent about any such right.
Sentence 227: We, on the contrary, deny that such a right has any existence in the Constitution, even by implication.
Sentence 228: Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the Government, unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please, on all points in dispute between you and us.
Sentence 229: You will rule or ruin in all events.
Sentence 230: This, plainly stated, is your language.
Sentence 231: Perhaps you will say the Supreme Court has decided the disputed Constitutional question in your favor.
Sentence 232: Not quite so.
Sentence 233: But waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and decision, the Court have decided the question for you in a sort of way.
Sentence 234: The Court have substantially said, it is your Constitutional right to take slaves into the federal territories, and to hold them there as property.
Sentence 235: When I say the decision was made in a sort of way, I mean it was made in a divided Court, by a bare majority of the Judges, and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it; that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning, and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact - the statement in the opinion that "the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution."
Sentence 236: An inspection of the Constitution will show that the right of property in a slave is not
"distinctly
and
expressly
affirmed" in it.
Sentence 237: Bear in mind, the Judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is
impliedly
affirmed in the Constitution; but they pledge their veracity that it is
"distinctly
and
expressly"
affirmed there - "distinctly," that is, not mingled with anything else - "expressly," that is, in words meaning just that, without the aid of any inference, and susceptible of no other meaning.
Sentence 238: If they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is affirmed in the instrument by implication, it would be open to others to show that neither the word "slave" nor "slavery" is to be found in the Constitution, nor the word "property" even, in any connection with language alluding to the things slave, or slavery; and that wherever in that instrument the slave is alluded to, he is called a "person;" - and wherever his master's legal right in relation to him is alluded to, it is spoken of as "service or labor which may be due," - as a debt payable in service or labor.
Sentence 239: Also, it would be open to show, by contemporaneous history, that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery, instead of speaking of them, was employed on purpose to exclude from the Constitution the idea that there could be property in man.
Sentence 240: To show all this, is easy and certain.
Sentence 241: When this obvious mistake of the Judges shall be brought to their notice, is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement, and reconsider the conclusion based upon it?
Sentence 242: And then it is to be remembered that "our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live" - the men who made the Constitution - decided this same Constitutional question in our favor, long ago - decided it without division among themselves, when making the decision; without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made, and, so far as any evidence is left, without basing it upon any mistaken statement of facts.
Sentence 243: Under all these circumstances, do you really feel yourselves justified to break up this Government unless such a court decision as yours is, shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action?
Sentence 244: But you will not abide the election of a Republican president!
Sentence 245: In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us!
Sentence 246: That is cool.
Sentence 247: A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth, "Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you will be a murderer!"
To be sure, what the robber demanded of me - my money - was my own; and I had a clear right to keep it; but it was no more my own than my vote is my own; and the threat of death to me, to extort my money, and the threat of destruction to the Union, to extort my vote, can scarcely be distinguished in principle.
Sentence 248: A few words now to Republicans.
Sentence 249: It is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great Confederacy shall be at peace, and in harmony, one with another.
Sentence 250: Let us Republicans do our part to have it so.
Sentence 251: Even though much provoked, let us do nothing through passion and ill temper.
Sentence 252: Even though the southern people will not so much as listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of our duty, we possibly can.
Sentence 253: Judging by all they say and do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy them.
Sentence 254: Will they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered to them?
Sentence 255: We know they will not.
Sentence 256: In all their present complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely mentioned.
Sentence 257: Invasions and insurrections are the rage now.
Sentence 258: Will it satisfy them, if, in the future, we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?
Sentence 259: We know it will not.
Sentence 260: We so know, because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation.
Sentence 261: The question recurs, what will satisfy them?
Sentence 262: Simply this: We must not only let them alone, but we must somehow, convince them that we do let them alone.
Sentence 263: This, we know by experience, is no easy task.
Sentence 264: We have been so trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization, but with no success.
Sentence 265: In all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone; but this has had no tendency to convince them.
Sentence 266: Alike unavailing to convince them, is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them.
Sentence 267: These natural, and apparently adequate means all failing, what will convince them?
Sentence 268: This, and this only: cease to call slavery
wrong,
and join them in calling it
right.
Sentence 269: And this must be done thoroughly - done in
acts
as well as in
words
.
Sentence 270: Silence will not be tolerated - we must place ourselves avowedly with them.
Sentence 271: Senator Douglas' new sedition law must be enacted and enforced, suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong, whether made in politics, in presses, in pulpits, or in private.
Sentence 272: We must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure.
Sentence 273: We must pull down our Free State constitutions.
Sentence 274: The whole atmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery, before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us.
Sentence 275: I am quite aware they do not state their case precisely in this way.
Sentence 276: Most of them would probably say to us, "Let us alone, do nothing to us, and say what you please about slavery."
Sentence 277: But we do let them alone - have never disturbed them - so that, after all, it is what we say, which dissatisfies them.
Sentence 278: They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we cease saying.
Sentence 279: I am also aware they have not, as yet, in terms, demanded the overthrow of our Free-State Constitutions.
Sentence 280: Yet those Constitutions declare the wrong of slavery, with more solemn emphasis, than do all other sayings against it; and when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow of these Constitutions will be demanded, and nothing be left to resist the demand.
Sentence 281: It is nothing to the contrary, that they do not demand the whole of this just now.
Sentence 282: Demanding what they do, and for the reason they do, they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation.
Sentence 283: Holding, as they do, that slavery is morally right, and socially elevating, they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition of it, as a legal right, and a social blessing.
Sentence 284: Nor can we justifiably withhold this, on any ground save our conviction that slavery is wrong.
Sentence 285: If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and constitutions against it, are themselves wrong, and should be silenced, and swept away.
Sentence 286: If it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality - its universality; if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its extension - its enlargement.
Sentence 287: All they ask, we could readily grant, if we thought slavery right; all we ask, they could as readily grant, if they thought it wrong.
Sentence 288: Their thinking it right, and our thinking it wrong, is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy.
Sentence 289: Thinking it right, as they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition, as being right; but, thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield to them?
Sentence 290: Can we cast our votes with their view, and against our own?
Sentence 291: In view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?
Wrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it is, because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread into the National Territories, and to overrun us here in these Free States?
Sentence 292: If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our duty, fearlessly and effectively.
Sentence 293: Let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored - contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man - such as a policy of "don't care" on a question about which all true men do care - such as Union appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and calling, not the sinners, but the righteous to repentance - such as invocations to Washington, imploring men to unsay what Washington said, and undo what Washington did.
Sentence 294: Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government nor of dungeons to ourselves.
Sentence 295: Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.
