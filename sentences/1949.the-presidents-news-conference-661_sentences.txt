THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I have a couple of announcements to make.
Sentence 4: I requested the Congress for an additional million dollars for disaster relief, to be used in part to meet critical conditions caused by snowstorms in Western States.

On January 29 the President wrote to Secretary Forrestal directing him to utilize such resources of the National Military Establishment as were appropriate to the relief of the disaster area, based on requests by the Federal Works Administrator.
Sentence 11: The letter continued as follows:
"The Departments of the National Military Establishment are authorized and directed to expend such sums as are required for this purpose from any funds now available to those departments, including funds available for river and harbor and flood control works of the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, without regard for existing apportionments.
Sentence 12: I will transmit to the Congress a request for such appropriations as may be considered necessary to replace such funds of the Departments of the National Military Establishment as may be used for this purpose."

Sentence 24: This will be the Prime Minister's first trip to the United States since he assumed his duties as Prime Minister.

Sentence 31: I wouldn't attempt to pronounce it.
