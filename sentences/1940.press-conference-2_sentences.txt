Sentence 1: 1940 Press Conference 2

THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 2: I only have one thing of importance.
Sentence 3: I shall give you the mimeographed copy of this [indicating typewritten sheet in his hand].
Sentence 4: It is being put on the mimeograph now.
Sentence 5: [Reading]
"At the request of the President, the Under Secretary of State Mr. Sumner Welles will proceed shortly to Europe to visit Italy, France, Germany and Great Britain.
Sentence 6: This visit is solely for the purpose of advising the President and the Secretary of State as to present conditions in Europe.
Sentence 7: "Mr. Welles will, of course, be authorized to make no proposals or commitments in the name of the Government of the United States.
Sentence 8: "Furthermore, statements made to him by officials of Governments will be kept in the strictest confidence and will be communicated by him solely to the President and the Secretary of State.
Sentence 9: "
I think, just as a tip, that you had better just stand on that language.
Sentence 10: That is all there is to say.
Sentence 11: Using the same old phrase I used before, do not try to break it down by impossible questions.
Sentence 12: The thing states the actual fact, the whole of the actual fact, and there isn't anything more.
Sentence 13: That is really the whole thing.
Sentence 14: It is right there in those three paragraphs.
Sentence 15: Q. Will you name those countries again?
Sentence 16: THE PRESIDENT: Italy, France, Germany and Great Britain.
Sentence 17: Q. Will there be a possibility of including Finland in those?
Sentence 18: THE PRESIDENT: No, no.
Sentence 19: Q.
Sentence 20: You have information from these countries and from the Diplomatic Service right along, I presume?
Sentence 21: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 22: Yes.
Q.
Sentence 23: And while that does state the case, the question arose in my mind—well, it sounds rather brusque—isn't your information satisfactory up to date?
Sentence 24: I mean, do you need a new reporter?
Sentence 25: THE PRESIDENT: You may put it this way: Suppose three or four of you were each in a separate country, an entirely separate country.
Sentence 26: Probably, although you were getting everything that there was in a very excellent way from the country that you were in, it might be a good thing to get somebody to see all the conditions in all the countries so that one mind would be able to cover the situation instead of having four separate minds reporting on separate things. . . .
Sentence 27: Q. Have these countries been approached?
Sentence 28: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Q.
Sentence 29: How long will Mr. Welles be gone, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: As long as necessary to go to those places.
Sentence 30: Q. Is it a presumption that Welles will seek an audience with Herr Hitler?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 31: I do not know; I do not know; it is a pure guess.
Sentence 32: Q. How long do you expect Mr. Welles to be gone?
Sentence 33: THE PRESIDENT: As long as it is necessary to go around to those four places.
Sentence 34: Q.
Sentence 35: You have no time in mind?
Sentence 36: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Q.
Sentence 37: When will he depart?
Sentence 38: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 39: Shortly.
Sentence 40: I do not know, honestly, when or which way he is going.
Sentence 41: Q. Have you advised the Congressional leaders of Mr. Welles' journey?
Sentence 42: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 43: No, it is purely a matter for the President and the Secretary of State.
Sentence 44: Q. Will his office be filled by someone else here during his absence?
Sentence 45: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Sentence 46: Q.
Sentence 47: When is Myron Taylor leaving, Mr. President?
Sentence 48: THE PRESIDENT: I think he is going—the seventeenth, isn't it?
Sentence 49: I think so.
Sentence 50: Q.
Sentence 51: Well, he said yesterday, sir, that you would tell us and also if there was any other—he indicated there was something else in connection with his visit that might be news, leaving it to you.
Sentence 52: Do you recognize that?
Sentence 53: THE PRESIDENT: I do not think so.
Sentence 54: I cannot think of anything, no.
Sentence 55: [Pausing in reflection.]
Sentence 56: No, I gave him a letter, that is the only thing I can think of.
Sentence 57: It is just a personal letter from me, asking him to go, with nothing else in it.
Sentence 58: Q.
Sentence 59: It may be that the date was in mind.
Sentence 60: Q. Mr. President, will Mr. Welles have with him any general message of any kind?
Sentence 61: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 62: No.
Q.
Sentence 63: Will he have any staff with him?
Sentence 64: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Sentence 65: Q.
Sentence 66: What do you think of the Congressional proposal to lend Finland the money which she has paid on her debt to this country, that money to be paid for the purchase of munitions, arms or anything she may wish?
Sentence 67: THE PRESIDENT: I don't know how many different proposals there are on the Hill.
Sentence 68: I sent a message up there, and they are still talking about it.
Sentence 69: And it has been, what?
Sentence 70: Three weeks nearly—it has been just about a month.
Sentence 71: Q. Will Mr. Taylor go directly to Rome or to Florence?
Sentence 72: THE PRESIDENT: I do not know.
Sentence 73: I suppose he will go to Rome.
Sentence 74: Q. Will Mr. Welles be in a position to discuss informally and without any binding, your personal view or the views of this Government on a possible peace?
Sentence 75: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 76: There you go.
Sentence 77: Now, do not get didactic.
Sentence 78: You have to stand on this statement: "for the purpose of advising the President and the Secretary of State as to present conditions in Europe.
Sentence 79: "
Now, I have no idea, any more than you have, whom he will talk to, and what he will say, and what they will say to him.
Sentence 80: Now that is the whole thing.
Sentence 81: It is all in one sentence and probably anything you add, any of you, columnists or anything else, to enlarge on this, will be wrong ....
Sentence 82: Q.
Sentence 83: The Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor, I believe, telegraphed you yesterday, asking you to make public the replies of the C.I.O. and the A.F. of L. to your latest peace gesture?
Sentence 84: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 85: The very simple thing is that on October third
Sentence 86: I got an official telegram from Bill Green, from Cincinnati, Ohio.
Sentence 87: The important part of it is— of course there is a whole lot of other stuff in here: [Reading]
"As a partial reply thereto—"'
That is to my letter to the convention
Sentence 88: [Reading]
"—I am mailing you copy of report of Executive Council American Federation Labor to convention upon negotiations carried on by committees representing American Federation of Labor and C.I.O. during past year.
Sentence 89: I especially direct your attention to last paragraph in said report which reads as follows: 'Our Committee still stands clothed with authority to function ready to resume negotiations when it is accorded an opportunity to do so.
Sentence 90: We have opened the door of the American Federation of Labor wide and completely.
Sentence 91: We have invited those who left the American Federation of Labor to return: we have urged them to come back home and settle differences within the family of labor in a sensible, honest, and fair way.
Sentence 92: In doing this we have been inspired by a genuine desire to establish here in America a solid united labor movement through which the economic social and industrial interests of the workers of the nation can be fully and completely served.'
Sentence 93: "
Well, I did not have any official or formal reply from the C.I.O. but-I cannot give you the date, sometime last—I guess it was before Christmas—I asked John Lewis about the reconvening of the Committee and he said at that time mind you, this was before Christmas, I cannot tell you the time—he said at that time that he did not think any useful purpose would be served by a meeting of this joint committee at this time.
Sentence 94: Now, that is pretty old news.
Sentence 95: What has happened since then I do not know.
Sentence 96: That is as of some date before Christmas. . . .
Sentence 97: Q. There has been considerable discussion of the possibility of the S.E.C. taking over that Associated Gas receivership.
Sentence 98: Would you care to express an opinion as to whether that may be advisable?
Sentence 99: THE PRESIDENT: Heavens, no. Isn't that in the hands of the court?
Sentence 100: Q. it is still in the hands of the court.
Sentence 101: THE PRESIDENT: Don't you think that it might be proper to let the court decide that without an expression of opinion by me?
Sentence 102: Q. Mr. President, the papers this morning said you had talked with various Army and Navy people about the sale of surplus arms to Norway and Sweden.
Sentence 103: Would you care to say anything about that?
Sentence 104: THE PRESIDENT: Not just Norway and Sweden, but any neutral countries.
Sentence 105: What we were talking about yesterday was a check-up on what may properly be considered surplus.
Sentence 106: They are working on lists of things that can properly be considered surplus.
Sentence 107: You know there is always a question about that.
Sentence 108: I remember back in 1913, the Navy still had tied up some old ships of the Civil War period; and a lot of people said, "Oh, no, don't sell them; don't scrap them; they are not surplus."
Sentence 109: Well, we did sell them.
Sentence 110: And just the other day we dug up about 450 thousand pairs of shoes that the Army had that were bought during the World War.
Sentence 111: Well, you know I love old shoes, and most people do; but new shoes that are twenty-two years old-I do not know that I would want to buy them, and would not know how long the sewing would hold together.
Sentence 112: That is all there is.
Sentence 113: It is a check-up to see what should reasonably be considered surplus or not.
Sentence 114: We have, for example, some British 75's, which we inherited during the World War, and, of course, even at that time they were not nearly as good as the French 75's.
Sentence 115: I suppose we could argue for a long time as to whether they should be called surplus or not.
Sentence 116: Q. Has there been any request from these neutral governments that we sell these surplus supplies?
Sentence 117: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 118: A great many neutral governments have been trying to buy—a great many, not just Norway and Sweden but a lot of others.
Sentence 119: Q.
Sentence 120: In view of the fact that war has not been formally declared, would Finland be considered a neutral country?
Sentence 121: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 122: I doubt if we would sell guns directly to Finland, because there is an armed conflict going on.
Sentence 123: I doubt it very much.
Sentence 124: I was talking about countries that are at peace.
Sentence 125: Q.
Sentence 126: That would include Italy?
Sentence 127: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 128: Italy certainly is not engaging in war, is it?
Sentence 129: Q. No.
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 130: Well, that is the answer. . .
Sentence 131: .
Sentence 132: Oh, there was one thing.
Sentence 133: I got Lauch Currie to check up on those figures that I talked about on Monday at Hyde Park.
Sentence 134: Of course, the record, the stenographic record, shows that I talked about private debts in with Government, local, State and municipal Government debts.
Sentence 135: Obviously, of course, that was necessarily so, and the actual figures do prove that the total debt of the Nation as a whole is less today by a few billion dollars than it was in 1932, and therefore there is-I do not think that there is anything very much more to add.
Sentence 136: Q.
Sentence 137: That would include all Government and all private debts?
Sentence 138: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 139: Yes, of course.
Q.
Sentence 140: In that connection, the only figures I have found on private debt are those that were put out by the A.A.A., that report which shows the total debt, public and private, is $9,000,000,000 higher today than it was in 1932.
Sentence 141: THE PRESIDENT: No, because that report duplicated quite a number of things.
Sentence 142: Q. Where can we get a reliable
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 143: [interposing] Oh, ask Lauch Currie about it.
Sentence 144: Of course that raises a nice question as to what is debt.
Sentence 145: What is debt?
Sentence 146: Well, now, just the simplest thing in the world, and I have used this illustration before, many times, as to the proposition of honorable statement.
Sentence 147: Suppose you borrow $10,000 and have assets of $100,000.
Sentence 148: Is it a fair thing for me to go around town saying that you owe $10,000, that you are in debt $10,000?
Sentence 149: Probably you could not open an account at a new store if that was the only half of the story that was told.
Sentence 150: Now, that is a very, very simple proposition because it involves a question of honesty.
Sentence 151: If the total Government debt, the Federal Government debt, is called $40,000,000,000 or $42,000,000,000, is it fair to stop there?
Sentence 152: It is a nice question.
Sentence 153: Is it a fair, honorable thing to do?
Sentence 154: And yet you see it, day after day, in print.
Sentence 155: Frankly, I do not think it is quite honorable.
Sentence 156: Now these figures, of course, are based on net debt.
Sentence 157: They are based on non-duplicating things.
Sentence 158: It is the same old story.
Sentence 159: But the fact remains that the population has gone up quite a lot.
Sentence 160: We shall not know until later on this year to what the population has gone up since 1932, but I imagine it is six or seven per cent, at a guess.
Sentence 161: Don't you think so?
MR. CURRIE:
Sentence 162: Yes.
Sentence 163: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 164: The population has gone up six or seven per cent.
Sentence 165: That means, actually, it is six or seven per cent larger, and yet the total debt of the United States in dollars is less than it was then.
Sentence 166: Q. Are you talking about debt or net worth?
Sentence 167: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 168: What?
Sentence 169: Q.
Sentence 170: What I mean is, when you say debt, are you subtracting from the Federal debt the gold the Federal Treasury has, etc.?
Sentence 171: THE PRESIDENT: I don't follow it.
Sentence 172: MR. CURRIE:
Sentence 173: The net Federal debt subtracts the cash on hand and the gold and the proprietary interest, and if you do that also with States and municipalities, and take of[ the duplication of the Federal agencies being covered twice in the A.A.A. figures, you have a three or four billion dollar decrease.
Sentence 174: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 175: Three or four billion dollars less debt.
Sentence 176: Q.
Sentence 177: What do you mean by the Federal agencies being counted twice?
Sentence 178: MR. CURRIE:
Sentence 179: It includes both the guaranteed debt owed by the agencies and also the private debt owed to the Federal agencies.
Sentence 180: It is an obvious case of duplication.
Sentence 181: These figures are being revised now.
Sentence 182: Q.
Sentence 183: Do you take credit for all the properties owned by cities?
Sentence 184: MR. CURRIE: No, just their cash and sinking funds.
Sentence 185: THE PRESIDENT: No, not any more than you take credit for the national parks and public lands owned by the Government.
Sentence 186: You apply the same rule.
Sentence 187: Q. Are there any figures available to show how much private debt was wiped out in bankruptcy and similar proceedings during this period?
Sentence 188: THE PRESIDENT: I suppose so.
Sentence 189: I have never seen any of them, have you?
Sentence 190: MR. CURRIE: No.
Q.
Sentence 191: How much money have you collected back from the Government agencies that you mentioned in your Budget?
Sentence 192: I think it was $700,000,000 that you expected to get back this year.
Sentence 193: Has that money been rolling in?
Sentence 194: Can you tell us how much?
Sentence 195: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 196: No, I do not think that comes in until the beginning of the new fiscal year.
