Sentence 46: Q. Mr. President, I hate to pursue this Baruch thing further, but I take it by your answer that you made, that you have outlined your proposals to meet the Korean situation as of now?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: I have, and I think they are the right ones, or I wouldn't have done it.
Sentence 48: Q. Yes, sir.
Sentence 49: [6.]
Sentence 50: Q. Mr. President, there are rumors all around town, including the Capitol, that you are going to ask for price and wage control by Labor Day, and that the ration books are already being printed?
Sentence 51: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: They know more about it than I do.
Sentence 53: I have never heard of that.
Sentence 54: Q.
Sentence 55: It was asked of Mr. Symington, and he said it was news to him.
Sentence 56: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 60: Q. Mr. President, do you expect any further delay in the transition to civil government on Guam?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 63: [8.]
Sentence 64: Q. Mr. President, there is some legislation on the Hill to deal with aliens and subversives.
Sentence 65: I wonder if you would discuss your ideas of legislation in relation to your warning about sabotage and espionage last week ?
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: Well, we want to be very careful in times like these that we don't get in the alien and sedition mood of 1798.
Sentence 68: The Bill of Rights is still a part of the Constitution of the United States, and a most important part.
Sentence 69: That doesn't mean that we are going to overlook any operation to see that traitors and saboteurs are properly taken care of.
Sentence 70: [9.]
Sentence 71: Q. Mr. President, your message to Congress and your Economic Message yesterday mention the possibility of price control.
Sentence 72: At what phase in the mobilization efforts, sir, would you consider wage controls might be necessary?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 73: Whenever it is necessary for price controls and wage controls, and manpower allocations, why the step will be taken altogether.
Sentence 74: Q.
Sentence 75: Do you think that it will be necessary?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: I do not.
Sentence 77: Q. Mr. President, if you should ask for price controls and rationing, will that be along with an excess profits tax?
Sentence 78: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: The tax situation is one that should be worked out on a basis of equity for all concerned.
Sentence 80: It is a very controversial subject, particularly what you call excess profits taxes.
Sentence 81: The reason I asked for a direct levy on incomes and corporations, I think that can be done promptly.
Sentence 82: And then after the election is over this fall, it will give the Congress a chance to work out an equitable tax program, which they should have done 4 years ago.
Sentence 83: Q.
Sentence 84: But you see no possibility, Mr. President, of wage and price controls?
Sentence 85: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 86: No--not right now.
Sentence 87: Q. Mr. President, would the institution of wage and price controls depend on the development of the Korean situation, or development of inflation at home?
Sentence 88: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: Depends on the world situation, and the situation at home, of course.
Sentence 90: Q. Mr. President, Mr. Baruch said that when it is done it should be rolled back to June 25th.

Sentence 93: [10.]
Sentence 94: Q. Mr. President, you have said in the past, several times, that you would not hesitate to use the atomic bomb in case of aggression.
Sentence 95: Are you considering such a step no?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: No.
Sentence 97: [11.]
Sentence 98: Q. Mr. President, in your message last week you said that you would ask Congress for more arms aid funds.
Sentence 99: Is it contemplated that would be done before Congress adjourns?
THE PRESIDENT.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: The Atlantic Pact countries.
Sentence 108: [12.]
Sentence 109: Q. One more question, sir, in connection with working out the tax program.
Sentence 110: You said that that could be done after the elections.
Sentence 111: You have in mind, sir, that Congress should be on hand after the elections this fall ?
Sentence 112: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 113: We will attend to that when the time arises.
Sentence 114: [13.]
Sentence 115: Q. Mr. President, a short time ago you said that the outlook on world peace was better than since 1945.
Sentence 116: Can you tell us what you think about the situation now?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: Well, you had better wait for a few more developments before we come to any conclusions on the subject.
Sentence 118: Q.
Sentence 119: What was that?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: They wanted to know what I thought about world peace now, because I had said a month or 2 ago that I thought the prospects were better than they had been since 1945.
Sentence 121: I said we had better await further information before we make any statement on that subject now.
Sentence 122: [14.]
Sentence 123: Q. Do you think that the Korean situation indicates a comparative need for speeding up the civilian defense planning, especially regarding Washington as a center of government?
Sentence 124: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 125: Civilian defense planning has been going on all the time.
Sentence 126: Civilian defense planning is most important, and we have been working at it strenuously ever since the program was authorized.
Sentence 127: And we are much further along with it than anybody has any idea about.
Sentence 128: Sometime or other we will be able to tell you about it, but not now.
Sentence 129: [15.]
Sentence 130: Q. Mr. President, are you planning to go to Missouri to vote in the primary?

Q. By an absentee ballot.
Sentence 134: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 135: I voted the Democratic ticket, and it's a secret ballot, and I am not going to tell you who I voted for.

Sentence 137: [16.]
Sentence 138: Q.
Sentence 139: The other question was, you were invited to Indianapolis August 20th to dedicate a new Legion building.
Sentence 140: Governor Schricker had some idea you might come?
Sentence 141: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 142: I don't think there is any possibility of my getting out of Washington any time soon.
Sentence 143: I want to stay here on the job and do the best I can to help the situation along, and still hope reverently for world peace.
Sentence 144: [17.]
Sentence 145: Q. Mr. President, there has been some speculation about your dropping entirely the idea of campaigning this fall in the congressional elections.
Sentence 146: Has there been any decision on that one way or the other--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 147: No.
Q.--whether to go ahead, or whether you decide to drop--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 148: There has been no decision.
Sentence 149: Q. One way or the other?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: No.
Sentence 151: [18.]
Sentence 152: Q. Mr. President, can you say anything about the situation in Korea now?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 153: I would rather not comment on that.
Sentence 154: I think the communiqués of the New York Times covered the situation very well.
Sentence 155: [19.]

Mrs. May Craig of the Portland (Maine) Press Herald.
Sentence 180: Q.
Sentence 181: Can you tell us where?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 182: I am trying to get New England to wake up to the fact that they need a public power development over in that corner of the United States.
Sentence 183: We have a great public power development in the Northwest.
Sentence 184: We have one in the Southeast--one in the Southwest.
Sentence 185: New England is the only outfit that has been asleep at the switch on the subject.
Sentence 186: And then we have the middle part of the United States, which I am hoping to have developed in the same manner.
Sentence 187: You can't have too much power.
Sentence 188: Q. Could you tell me just what your first step will be?
Sentence 189: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 190: Well, I have a commission working on that, May, and when they make a report, I will tell you what it is.
Sentence 191: [22.]
Sentence 192: Q. Mr. President, I just want to get straight on the answer you made awhile ago on wage and price controls.
Sentence 193: I think you were asked if anything like that was in sight, or whether you contemplated any, and you said no.
Sentence 194: Would you like to qualify that at this time?
Sentence 195: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 196: No, not at this time.
Sentence 197: We have nothing like that in sight, because there is no necessity for it.
Sentence 198: [23.]
Sentence 199: Q. Mr. President, in your message last week, I believe, you said that you had asked department heads to resurvey their nonmilitary budgets.
Sentence 200: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 201: That is correct.
Sentence 202: Q. Are you getting any reports on that?
Sentence 203: Is there anything--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 204: I haven't had time yet.
Sentence 205: The letter only went out day before yesterday.
Sentence 206: Q. Are they to report to you, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 207: Yes, they are going to report to me--they report to the Budget and then to me.
Sentence 208: [24.]
Sentence 209: Q. Mr. President, just to further clarify the question, did I understand you to say that when those things come--rationing and price controls and wages--they will all come at once?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 210: They should, of course, yes.
Sentence 211: That will be all-out mobilization, and I hope we will not have to make an all-out mobilization.
Sentence 212: Q.
Sentence 213: By that, Mr. President, you mean the two steps of price controls and rationing would not come unless they were coupled with all-out mobilization?
Sentence 214: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 215: That is correct.
Sentence 216: Reporter:
Sentence 217: Thank you, sir.
