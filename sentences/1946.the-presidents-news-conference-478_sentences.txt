Sentence 1: 1946 The Presidents News Conference 478

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: Well, I haven't any special announcements to make to the press this morning, but I thought maybe the press might want to ask a question or two, so I thought I would let you in this morning.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: Q. Mr. President, has Mr. Stettinius talked to you about resigning?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 5: Mr. Stettinius sent me a letter of resignation based on the fact that he thought his--the job he agreed to do--
which was to complete the organization of the United Nations program--had been completed.
Sentence 6: I expressed the hope to him that he would not insist on that resignation-
Sentence 7: I want him to stay, and so does the Secretary of State.
Sentence 8: Q. Has he sent more than one letter of resignation--has he attempted it before, sir?
Sentence 9: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 10: No, he hasn't.
Sentence 11: This was a surprise to me.
Sentence 12: Q. When was it, Mr. President--the first letter?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 13: Day before yesterday-well, it has been 2 or 3 days ago.
Sentence 14: I think about Monday, probably.
Sentence 15: Q.
Sentence 16: That is where the matter stands now?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 17: That is where it stands.
Sentence 18: Q.
Sentence 19: You haven't heard from him since then, sir?
Sentence 20: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 21: I think he's going to stay.
Sentence 22: I am sure--I hope he will.
Sentence 23: [2.]
Sentence 24: Q. Mr. President, do you plan to sign the Case bill ?
Sentence 25: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 26: I will have to analyze the Case bill when it gets to me.
Sentence 27: I haven't seen it, and I don't know what it contains.
Sentence 28: I will give you the answer when I have had a chance to analyze it.
Sentence 29: [3.]
Sentence 30: Q. Mr. President, at Potsdam, do you recall whether Generalissimo Stalin proposed an all-German overall control agency for Germany?
Sentence 31: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 32: The agreement at Potsdam, as I remember it, was for a--communications, transportation, and finances was to be in overall control.
Sentence 33: That is as I remember the Potsdam agreement.
Sentence 34: I would have to look it up to be absolutely sure.
Sentence 35: Q. Molotov said in this blast the other day that this thing had been proposed by Stalin but never got anywhere--had been rejected.
Sentence 36: The first any of us had ever heard of it.
Sentence 37: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: Not rejected by us.
Sentence 39: It had to be rejected because of the inability of the four controlling powers to agree on all the details.
Sentence 40: I don't know who is at fault.
Sentence 41: The best thing to do is to ask the Secretary of State.
Sentence 42: I think he can answer that for you.
Sentence 43: [4.]
Sentence 44: Q. Mr. President, what do you think of Mr. Whitney's assertion that you signed your political death warrant?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 45: I have no comment.
Sentence 46: Q. Mr. President, have you seen the transcript Mr. Whitney put out of the reported conversation with you
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: No.
Sentence 48: I don't read Mr. Whitney.
Sentence 49: Q.
Sentence 50: What was that, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 51: I don't read Mr. Whitney.
Sentence 52: [5.]
Sentence 53: Q. Mr. President, do you think the Senate's action in eliminating the draft feature of your labor legislation greatly weakens the bill ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 54: I think so.
Sentence 55: I think that the draft provision in that bill has been grossly misrepresented and misunderstood.
Sentence 56: It is customary, in an emergency, even when a sheriff has an emergency in his county, he can deputize any citizen to act to enforce the law.
Sentence 57: That was really the power that I wanted, in that case, because we needed experts, particularly in the railroad situation, to run the trains; and I merely wanted the authority to deputize those fellows to meet the emergency, just as you would in any other great emergency.
Sentence 58: And I don't think it has been understood.
Sentence 59: I think they're misrepresenting it.
Sentence 60: It is not-was not intended as a "draft labor" proposal.
Sentence 61: It was a "draft citizens" proposal in an emergency.
Sentence 62: [6.]
Sentence 63: Q. Mr. President, have you any plans to see Stalin?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: No immediate plans.
Sentence 65: I would be glad to see him.
Sentence 66: I have invited him to visit me here in Washington on two occasions, and he has regretted that he couldn't come on account of his health.
Sentence 67: [7.]
Sentence 68: Q. Mr. President, it is reported in Italian newspapers that this Government plans to decorate King Umberto for his services to the Allied cause.
Sentence 69: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: I never heard of it.
Sentence 71: [8.]
Sentence 72: Q. Mr. President, how recently did you invite Mr. Stalin to visit you here?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 73: Well, let's see.
Sentence 74: I imagine it has been within 30 days.
Sentence 75: Q. Both times, sir, within 30 days?
Sentence 76: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 77: No, no.
Sentence 78: The first time was at Potsdam, and the second time about 30 days ago, in the correspondence between us on food and things, I have asked him if he wouldn't come over and pay a visit to me in Washington.
Sentence 79: Q. Did he reply each time it was because of ill health?
Sentence 80: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 81: He replied each time that his doctors did not think it was well for him to take such a long journey.
Sentence 82: That is almost exactly what he said.
Sentence 83: Q. Is there any question of meeting elsewhere?
Sentence 84: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 85: Not in the immediate future.
Sentence 86: [9.]
Sentence 87: Q. Mr. President, in view of the tone of the exchanges between Secretary Byrnes and Mr. Molotov, do you think there is much chance for success for the next Council of Foreign Ministers and much chance that the Russians will agree to the 21-nation peace conference?
Sentence 88: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: I can't answer a question like that, Bert.
Sentence 90: 1
That is a matter you ought to take up with the State Department.
Sentence 91: 1 Bert Andrews of the New York Herald Tribune.
Sentence 92: Q.
Sentence 93: They can't answer it either.
Sentence 94: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 95: All right then; you can't get an answer.
Sentence 96: [Laughter]
Sentence 97: [10.]
Sentence 98: Q. Mr. President, going back to this Stalin correspondence, sir, 10 days ago you said you might have something to say on release of that correspondence.
Sentence 99: Can we expect that now ?
Sentence 100: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: Well, I think it's all been released by the State Department.
Sentence 102: Q. No, sir--we have made inquiries over there, but the note has not been released.
Sentence 103: It has, on one broadcast from Moscow.
Sentence 104: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 105: I will refer you to the State Department, because there are complications in connection with it which the State Department will have to handle.
Sentence 106: [11.]
Sentence 107: Q. You remarked that you didn't have any plans for the immediate future for another international meeting on the top level.
Sentence 108: Does that mean there is one in the works that will come along
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 109: No, it doesn't.
Sentence 110: It means just what it says.
Sentence 111: [12.]
Sentence 112: Q. Mr. President, to return to the emergency legislation you recommended, do you still wholeheartedly support that recommendation?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 113: Of course I do.

Sentence 121: No.
Sentence 122: [14.]
Sentence 123: Q. Mr. President, on the Stettinius correspondence, do I understand it correctly that you have sent him a letter saying you hoped he wouldn't press his resignation?
Sentence 124: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 125: No.
Sentence 126: I haven't had a chance to answer his letter as yet.
Sentence 127: That is the sort of letter I am expecting to send to him.
Sentence 128: The letter came right in the middle of all this turmoil, and I haven't had the opportunity to answer it.
Sentence 129: [15.]
Sentence 130: Q. Mr. President, do you have any hope of averting the maritime strike ?
Sentence 131: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 133: Q.
Sentence 134: Those necessary preparations, Mr. President, include the Navy and War Shipping Administration taking them over?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 148: Q. Mr. President, in view of the legislative situation on the Hill, do you still expect to go--make the trip to the Philippines July 4th ?

Sentence 151: The situation on the Hill has a lot of time to develop between now and that time.
Sentence 152: I hope I can make the trip to the Philippines.
Sentence 153: [18.]
Sentence 154: Q. Mr. President, in your plan for meeting the maritime strike, do you have sufficient legislation now to arrange the--to make arrangements and go ahead with the--
THE PRESIDENT.

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 196: Yes I have.
Sentence 197: The difficulty with naming that Advisory Council is to get the proper men to accept the responsibility.
Sentence 198: Because of the treatment that some people get before the Senate and the Congress, it's a difficult matter to get the right sort of men to accept the possibility of that sort of treatment.
