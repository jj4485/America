THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have no statements for you this morning, but I will try to answer questions, if you have any.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: Q. Mr. President, do you know where we can get a boat to [Laughter].
Sentence 5: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 6: Tony,
1
I see a great many boats down there on the wharf all tied up, I thought you could hire one of those.
Sentence 7: Somebody told me that you were going to get Joe Grundy's yacht.
Sentence 8: 1
Ernest B. Vaccaro of the Associated Press.
Sentence 9: Q.
Sentence 10: We haven't had any luck, and we have scoured all the waterfronts.
Sentence 11: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 12: I'm sorry.
Sentence 13: I wish I had one to give you, but I haven't.
Sentence 14: Q. Have you got any Democratic friends with yachts?
Sentence 15: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 16: The only Democratic friend I have who has a yacht is in it now, and down in the Caribbean somewhere, and that's Joe Davies.
Sentence 17: Q.
Sentence 18: I understand he just started.
Sentence 19: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 20: Yes, I understand that is so.
Sentence 21: I don't think he would let you have it, though, because it's too fine for you fellows to tear up.
Sentence 22: [Laughter]
Sentence 23: [2.]
Sentence 24: Q. Mr. President, are you going into Miami to speak during the campaign, at the American Legion--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: The decision has not yet been reached on that.
Sentence 26: I will let you know in plenty of time.
Sentence 27: Q. Mr. President, there is a report out that you are going to Tennessee.
Sentence 28: Anything to it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 29: I will give you definite information on the places where I intend to go as soon as the itinerary is made up.
Sentence 30: No decision has been reached yet as to where I will go, except to Detroit.
Sentence 31: [3.]
Sentence 32: Q. Mr. President, could you tell us what progress, if any, has been made in Moscow on the four-power talks?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: I Can make no comment on that.
Sentence 34: [4.]
Sentence 35: Q. Mr. President, what do you think of Governor Dewey personally?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 36: Well, I like him personally.
Sentence 37: Q. Sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: I like him personally.
Sentence 39: I have been with him on several occasions.
Sentence 40: We have had very pleasant relations.
Sentence 41: [5.]
Sentence 42: Q. Mr. President, is it your idea that Federal Reserve should use its new powers over bank credit immediately?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 43: Certainly.
Sentence 44: That is what the bill was passed for, and they will use them as promptly as they can arrange them.
Sentence 45: Those things can't be done in a minute.
Sentence 46: It takes time to work them out because there are 12 Federal Reserve banks in the country, and they all have to be unanimous on a thing of that sort.
Sentence 47: It takes some time to get things worked out, but it will be, just as 'promptly as it possibly can.
Sentence 48: [6.]
Sentence 49: Q. Mr. President, a week or two ago you said that there was a good chance of an oil shortage on the east coast this winter.
Sentence 50: The oil industry now seems to think that there is plenty of supply.
Sentence 51: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: I sincerely hope that the oil industry is right.
Sentence 53: I doubt it very much.
Sentence 54: It depends, of course, on whether we have a hard winter or not.
Sentence 55: [7.]
Sentence 56: Q.
Sentence 57: What do you think of the actions of the Soviet schoolteachers in New York?
1
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: Well, I think that the actions of those teachers indicate that there are a lot of people who believe in the freedom of the individual, just as the whole United States does.
Sentence 59: 1
In August 1948 two Soviet schoolteachers, Mikhail I. Samarin and Mrs. Oksana Kosenkina, denounced the Soviet Union and asked for asylum in the United States.
Sentence 60: Mrs. Kosenkina was taken to the Soviet consulate in New York City and held there against her will.
Sentence 61: On August 12 she leaped from a third floor window of the consulate and was taken to a hospital in poor condition.
Sentence 62: She was dismissed from the hospital in November 1948, and she and Mr. Samarin were given asylum in the United States.
Sentence 63: Q. Mr. President, will the same right of asylum be granted to any other Russian citizens placed in similar circumstances?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: It always has been.
Sentence 65: [8.]
Sentence 66: Q. Mr. President, your new Secretary of Labor, Mr. Tobin, yesterday in commenting on the Great Lakes strike situation, in which the NLRB has ruled against the hiring hall, said that he felt the Taft-Hartley Act should be repealed, on the ground that it would promote bootlegging and under-the-table dealing between labor and management.
Sentence 67: Do you have any comment on that?
Sentence 68: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 69: I think I made it definite on that when I vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act.
Sentence 70: Covered it very thoroughly.
Sentence 71: And it is working out just as I stated it would work out in the veto message, if you will read it carefully.
Sentence 72: I am in agreement with the Secretary of Labor, or he is in agreement with me, whichever way you want to put it.
Sentence 73: [9.]
Sentence 74: Q. Mr. President, is it true that agreement has been reached on a $100 million loan to Palestine?
Sentence 75: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: It is under consideration.
Sentence 77: I do not know that any agreement has yet been reached.
Sentence 78: Q. Is it also under consideration that American troops may be used in Palestine?
Sentence 79: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 80: American troops will not be used in Palestine as American troops.
Sentence 81: We will make our contribution to the United Nations for any enforcement or police force that they may need, provided the United Nations and the rest of the members of the United Nations go along with us on the same basis.
Sentence 82: But no American troops as such will be sent to Palestine or any other place at the present time.
Sentence 83: [10.]
Sentence 84: Q. Mr. President, will you tell us something about the ladies who are guests at your press conference today?
Sentence 85: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 86: They happen to be Missourians who are friends of mine, and I just invited them to stay.
Sentence 87: All Democrats!
Sentence 88: [Laughter]
Sentence 89: [11.]
Sentence 90: Q. Mr. President, is that $100 million loan under consideration in the Export-Import Bank, or could you tell us where?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: It wouldn't be anywhere else.
Sentence 92: The Export-Import Bank is the one that would have to make the loan, and they have it under consideration.
Sentence 93: [12.]
Sentence 94: Q. Mr. President, is there any change in status of the Baltic refugees in Boston who are--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 95: No.
Sentence 96: I think I answered that as completely as I could at the last press conference,
1
or the one before that.
Sentence 97: Their status is just the same.
Sentence 98: 1
Item 174 [4].
Q.
Sentence 99: In other words, you are still trying to find a way to keep them here?
Sentence 100: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: Yes, yes.
Sentence 102: [13.]
Sentence 103: Q. Mr. President, is there any change in the dispute with Senator Ferguson as to what documents are available to Congress and what are not, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: The same documents are available to Congress as have always been available, and that is the employment file but not the confidential files.
Sentence 105: And the confidential files have been available to the FBI and to the loyalty boards, as they always have been ever since employees have been in the service of the Government and the FBI has been in existence.
Sentence 106: And those records, where there was anything of a criminal nature have been used by the grand jury and have been available to the grand jury all the time.
Sentence 107: [14.]
Sentence 108: Q. Mr. President, Governor Dewey is reported as saying he thought the Italian colonies should be returned to Italy.
Sentence 109: What do you think about that?
Sentence 110: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: Well, under the Italian peace treaty, those colonies are under consideration now by the four powers: Russia, Britain, France, and the United States.
Sentence 112: And under that Italian treaty, if those four powers do not reach agreement by the time the Assembly meets in Paris, then the matter goes into the General Assembly for consideration.
Sentence 113: That is a United Nations and a four-power power treaty proposition, and cannot very well be handled politically in the United States.
Sentence 114: [15.]
Sentence 115: Q. Mr. President, do you feel that the loyalty program as it has operated to date has added to--protected us against the infiltration--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 116: I can say categorically that it has.
Sentence 117: All the things that have been presented to these committees have been FBI files and have been presented to the grand jury long before that.
Sentence 118: And the only two people who were in the Government employ who have been accused of disloyalty--which hasn't been proven on them by any means-have been placed on indefinite leave, before the committee ever started any hearings.
Sentence 119: It has had no bearing whatever on the loyalty of the Government employees that are now on the payroll.
Sentence 120: Q.
Sentence 121: Then the program has been successful ?
Sentence 122: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 123: It has been very successful.
Sentence 124: It has been entirely successful, I might say.
Sentence 125: Q. Mr. President, in your opinion, were any vital war secrets ever carried out of this Government during the war?
Sentence 126: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 127: They were not.
Sentence 128: Q. Is it true, Mr. President, that the Department of Justice is now preparing a proposed new statute on loyalty and espionage?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 129: The Department of Justice for a long time has been working on such a statute, but it is a most difficult proposition under our form of government, and under freedom of speech and freedom of the press, to get a statute that does not infringe the Bill of Rights.
Sentence 130: And I am categorically opposed to any gestapo proposition that does infringe the Bill of Rights.
Sentence 131: That is the thing for which this Government stands, that is what we have been fighting for since 1776.
Sentence 132: We can't change our position at this late date.
Sentence 133: If you will go back and read the history of the alien and sedition laws, you will be surprised to find that it is almost the same--it was brought about by almost the same situation with which we have been faced now.
Sentence 134: Q. Mr. President, do you consider these House hearings have infringed on the Bill of Rights in any way?
Sentence 135: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 136: Yes, I do.
Sentence 137: [16.]
Sentence 138: Q. Mr. President, is your family going with you to Michigan?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 139: My daughter is.
Sentence 140: Mrs. Truman is in Colorado and won't be able to go.
Sentence 141: Margaret will go with me.
Sentence 142: Reporter:
Sentence 143: Thank you, sir.
Sentence 144: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: You are entirely welcome.
