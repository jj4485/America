Sentence 1: 1948 The Presidents News Conference 341

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1] First, I want to pay attention to a vicious statement that was made by a columnist in a New York gossip paper, in which he said I had made the statement to an editor of a New York paper here that the Jews in New York were disloyal.
Sentence 3: I had thought I wouldn't have to add another liar's star to that fellow's crown, but I will have to do it.
Sentence 4: That is just a lie out of the whole cloth.
Sentence 5: That is as emphatic as I can put it.
Sentence 6: Now I am ready for questions.

Sentence 8: May we quote you on that, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 24: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: No, I am not.
Sentence 26: [3.]
Sentence 27: Q. Mr. President, a year ago tomorrow you enunciated the Truman doctrine to contain communism, and in view of the fact in the past year that communism actually has expanded, I wonder if you would comment generally, particularly as to whether you feel the doctrine should now be expanded or strengthened .
Sentence 28: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 29: It does not need expansion.
Sentence 30: The so-called doctrine is part of the foreign policy of the United States.
Sentence 31: It is preliminary to the European recovery program which is a part of the same program.

Sentence 33: It has been successful, however, in what it was intended to do to date.
Sentence 34: [4.]
Sentence 35: Q. Mr. President, last December, and several times recently, you expressed confidence in ultimate world peace.

THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 38: We must have it, because we can't afford to destroy the whole world in another world war.
Sentence 39: [5.]
Sentence 40: Q. Mr. President, the key word in that statement which you just made was "promptly," I imagine?

Sentence 43: Promptly--that's correct.
Sentence 44: [6.]

Sentence 53: I cannot make any official statement on his death or its cause, because we have had no official comment on it.

Jan Masaryk, Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia.
Sentence 56: [8.]

Sentence 169: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 170: Chinese liberals.
Sentence 171: There is a very great difference between the liberal element in China and the Communists.

Sentence 173: There are a great many liberals in China.
Sentence 174: I talked to one of them just the day before yesterday.
Sentence 175: There are a great many of them who have been educated in this country, and they are the intelligentsia, really, of China.
