THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 3: I have a couple of announcements I want to read to you; they are mimeographed and you can get copies of them when you get through.
Sentence 4: [1.]
Sentence 5: This is to the heads of Executive departments and agencies:
"It is my desire that not later than the week beginning September 9, 1945, all departments and agencies reduce their administrative workweek to the basic 40 hours a week, unless such reduction in hours would result in a serious detriment to their essential operations.
Sentence 6: This will permit the establishment of a 5-day workweek wherever feasible.
Sentence 7: In those cases where you decide that it is absolutely necessary to temporarily maintain a workweek in excess of 40 hours, please report to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget the reasons for your decision."
Sentence 8: [2.]
Sentence 9: Then this notice went out also:
"Since there would appear to be no further necessity for continuing the present requirements for work on public holidays, such holidays, as enumerated below, should be observed as nonwork days:
Sentence 10: "The 1st day of January, the 22d day of February, the 30th day of May, the 4th day of July, the 1st Monday of September, the 11th day of November, the 4th Thursday in November, and Christmas Day.
Sentence 11: "In addition, the general restrictions placed on leaves of absence because of war conditions are no longer necessary and the departments and agencies should return to their normal policies in granting leaves of absence for vacation purposes."

If you have any questions that I can answer, I'll try to answer them.

Sentence 22: Q. General Hershey, in a speech in Boston last night, said that unless the Draft Act is amended the right of employment of the veterans would expire on V-J Day.
Sentence 23: Would you favor legislation on that?
Sentence 24: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: I think General Hershey is speaking about the provision in the Draft Act that is apart from the provisions in the GI bill of rights.
Sentence 26: Q.
Sentence 27: He said there was no such provision in the GI bill of rights.
Sentence 28: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 29: I think it can be interpreted that way, but we can have that amended.
Sentence 30: The Draft Act ends with the proclamation declaring that hostilities have ceased and the war is over--which has not happened yet and won't happen for some time to come.
Sentence 31: Q.
Sentence 32: Do I understand you to mean that the original intention of the Draft Act giving the veterans their jobs back would remain even if you had to patch it up with further legislation ?
Sentence 33: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 34: That's what I intended to say.
Sentence 35: Q. Providing a new bill?
Sentence 36: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 37: The question was only in reference to the guarantee to veterans of their jobs.
Sentence 38: Q. Would that mean a new piece of legislation?
Sentence 39: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 40: It probably would require an amendment to the GI bill of rights, if that is not interpreted to mean what it says.
Sentence 41: [5.]
Sentence 42: Q. Mr. President, please tell us a little about your visit with General de Gaulle.
Sentence 43: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 45: We discussed questions that affect France and the United States, and instructed the Foreign Minister of France and the Secretary of State of the United States to discuss all the matters which are at issue between France and the United States, and then submit those matters to General de Gaulle and myself for final decision if they could not reach an agreement which was satisfactory to both of us.
Sentence 46: Q.
Sentence 47: You expect to see him again?
Sentence 48: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 49: I imagine so.

Sentence 80: [10.]
Sentence 81: Q. Mr. President, do you plan any subsidies on copper and zinc, since these metals are now in good supply--plentiful?

Sentence 84: [11.]

Sentence 93: The President has directed the Foreign Economic Administrator to take steps immediately to discontinue all lend-lease operations and to notify foreign governments receiving lend-lease of this action.
Sentence 94: The President also directs that all outstanding contracts for lend-lense be canceled, except where Allied governments are willing to agree to take them over, or where it is in the interest of the United States to complete them.
Sentence 95: The Foreign Economic Administrator furthermore is instructed to negotiate with Allied governments for possible procurement by them of lend-lease inventories now in stockpile and in process of delivery.
Sentence 96: If the military needs lend-lease supplies for the movement of troops or for occupation purposes, the military will be responsible for procurement.
Sentence 97: It is estimated that uncompleted contracts for non-munitions and finished goods in this country not yet transferred to lend-lease countries amount to about $2 billion and that lend lease supplies in stockpile abroad amount to between $1 and $1 1/2 billion.
Sentence 98: [13.]
Sentence 99: Q. Mr. President, do you take the view of General Hershey with regard to the Draft Act ?
Sentence 100: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: I am not legally inclined, and I don't know the legal provisions in the Draft Act, because I haven't studied it; so I can't give you my views on that.
Sentence 102: Q.
Sentence 103: The Hershey view is--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: General Hershey ought to know what he is talking about; he has been enforcing the Draft Act for some time.

Sentence 106: [14.]
Sentence 107: Q. Mr. President, have your ideas on reorganization reached the point where you want to discuss them?

Sentence 119: I haven't heard anything about it.
Sentence 120: [17.]

Sentence 123: Yes, I have talked with the Secretaries of War and Navy, General Marshall, and Admiral King; and their armed services are doing everything in their power to expedite demobilization.
Sentence 124: It wouldn't make any difference what sort of plan they had, somebody wouldn't like it.

Sentence 126: Q. Mr. President, the British Prime Minister has discussed Franco-Spain; do you care to go a little further on that?

Sentence 146: What would be the legal significance of declaration of V-J Day?

Sentence 154: Q. Mr. President, would you care to discuss the future of Indochina and Thailand?

Sentence 157: Q. Thank you.
Sentence 158: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 160: [22.]

Sentence 162: Will you give us an illustration of that?
Sentence 163: THE PRESIDENT.

The President referred to a White House release dated August 21.
Sentence 169: For text, see footnote to [12] of this news conference.
Sentence 170: On August 29 the following statement was released simultaneously in Washington, Ottawa, and London:
"On January 19th, 1945, the President of the United States and the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and Canada announced their decision to maintain the Combined Production and Resources Board, Combined Raw Materials Board and Combined Food Board until the end of the Japanese War.
Sentence 171: The three governments have now decided that these three boards will continue, for the time being, to operate on the existing basis in order to ensure that there is no break in combined machinery, which is handling various critical supply questions of immediate importance.
Sentence 172: They will also arrange without delay for a review of the work of each Board with the object of determining the necessity for continuing its operation.
Sentence 173: "
See also Item 209.
Sentence 174: Q.
Sentence 175: Can you tell us the reasons for termination of lend-lease?
Sentence 176: There have been statements that it was a direct blow at the British Government.
Sentence 177: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 178: That is not true at all.
Sentence 179: The reason is that the bill was passed by Congress defining lend-lease as a weapon of war, and after we cease to be at war it is no longer necessary.
Sentence 180: I happened to be Vice President at the time that law was extended and I made such a promise.
Sentence 181: I am merely living up to the promise I made as Vice President of the United States.
Sentence 182: Q.
Sentence 183: We haven't yet ceased to be at war.
Sentence 184: We--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 185: No, but hostilities have ceased.
Sentence 186: Hostilities are not going on.
Sentence 187: We are not conducting a war.
Sentence 188: I think, technically, we have come to the point where it is not necessary to continue lend-lease.
Sentence 189: [23.]
Sentence 190: Q. Sir, do you anticipate making any recommendation about the advance time-- war time?
Sentence 191: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 192: That will be taken care of in the message to Congress the 5th of September.
Sentence 193: I think we will go back to standard time.
Sentence 194: The States can do whatever they choose.
Sentence 195: Q. Sir, what else might be in that message?
Sentence 196: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 197: I'll give you that message when I get it ready.
Sentence 198: Voices: Thank you, Mr. President.
