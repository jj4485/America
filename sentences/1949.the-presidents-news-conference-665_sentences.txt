THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: This happens to be the 200th press conference that has been held since I have been President, in the course of 234 weeks, I believe.
Sentence 4: And I have no special announcements to make to you this morning.
Sentence 5: [2.]
Sentence 6: Q. Mr. President, I have been asked to ask you if you would name any of the special interests that you have referred to sometimes in some of your recent speeches?

Sentence 13: There will be continuing recommendations from the committee which I appointed.

Sentence 22: I believe you said at the time that he was carrying out White House instructions.
Sentence 23: I am wondering if you have ordered any economy wave in any of the other departments?
Sentence 24: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: The economy wave, if you remember, was for the Department of Defense, and that covered all the departments in the Department of Defense, and it covers every other department in the Government.
Sentence 26: I think, if you will make an investigation, you will find that the Department of Agriculture has been cut down immensely since its wartime effort, as has every other department of the Government.
Sentence 27: Some day I will give you some figures on that that will startle you a little bit.
Sentence 28: The economy wave is always carried out by the Executive.
Sentence 29: The rest of the people talk about it.
Sentence 30: [5.]
Sentence 31: Q. Mr. President, two members of the Cabinet yesterday warned of the effect of the coal and steel strikes on the economy.
Sentence 32: When do you plan to step into that situation?

Sentence 45: Q. Mr. President, I notice Mr. Boyle sent a message out to all State chairmen for them to get behind Senators to confirm Leland Olds.
Sentence 46: Is that a new departure in politics?
Sentence 47: I don't remember a national chairman putting the heat on Senators and Representatives.
Sentence 48: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 49: I remember it very distinctly.
Sentence 50: It was customary when Jim Farley was chairman.
Sentence 51: I had the heat put on me by Jim.
Sentence 52: [Laughter] It is customary, and it is proper, and it should be done, and Bill Boyle is doing it because I asked him to.
Sentence 53: Q. Isn't the only difference that Mr. Boyle is doing it publicly and it used to be done without any publicity?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 54: It wasn't done so privately, as I remember it very distinctly.

Sentence 60: Not anything wrong, and it should be done.
Sentence 61: If we are going to have party discipline in this country, then we must run our two-party system with party responsibility.
Sentence 62: Q. Isn't that lobbying?
Sentence 63: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 64: I beg your pardon?
Sentence 65: Q. Isn't that the same as lobbying?
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: No, not necessarily.
Sentence 68: You have got to have party discipline, if you are going to transact the business of the Government.
Sentence 69: One of the things that you gentlemen do sometimes is to point the finger of shame at a fellow when he's loyal to his party; and it isn't the right thing to do.
Sentence 70: A man is elected on a party platform, and he ought to carry out what the party promises to do.
Sentence 71: Q. Mr. President, does your remark on discipline apply to the Senators who voted against Mr. Olds?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 72: That is a question I can't answer at the present time.
Sentence 73: Q. Mr. President, do you expect them to be more in line than you were in the case of Pat Harrison?
Sentence 74: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 75: That's a good question.
Sentence 76: I was not informed that it was a party matter when the thing came up.
Sentence 77: If I had been informed in time, I would have stayed with the party, and besides that, it was a Democratic fight in the beginning.
Sentence 78: That was not a party matter at all.
Sentence 79: [8.]

Sentence 108: All you have to do is read the message, and you will get all the information.
