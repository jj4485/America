Sentence 1: 1937 Press Conference 18

THE PRESIDENT: Good people, how are you?
Sentence 2: Glad to see you.
Sentence 3: Q.
Sentence 4: You look all right.
Sentence 5: I thought you were sick.
Sentence 6: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 7: I think we ought to get a chair for the Dean[Mr.
Sentence 8: Young].
Sentence 9: Pull it up, it is right behind you. . . .
Sentence 10: Q.
Sentence 11: We were interested, sir, in encountering Mr. Willkie as he went out.
Sentence 12: THE PRESIDENT: We had a very, very interesting talk that lasted about an hour and twenty-five minutes.
Sentence 13: Q. What about, sir?
Sentence 14: THE PRESIDENT; About utilities in general.
Sentence 15: I should say that Mr. McNinch and he and I covered pretty nearly the whole field, talking on matters of general principle underlying the problem, with the objective and the hope that a very crying need in the country for additional power facilities can be met.
Sentence 16: The apparent need for expenditures in the coming year runs from a billion and a quarter dollars to a billion and a half.
Sentence 17: We are all agreed on the need of expanding facilities.
Sentence 18: Q.
Sentence 19: For the power companies?
THE PRESIDENT: All the power in the United States.
Sentence 20: And then I brought out some data which I have been getting recently which of course we all know about: that the use of power is going up practically every year—I am talking about power as a general thing—and the rather interesting fact that in the present set-up of power development in the United States, about ten percent is being generated by Government projects and the other ninety percent by private companies and municipalities.
Sentence 21: Is that right?
MR. MC NINCH:
Sentence 22: That is right.
Sentence 23: THE PRESIDENT: Of course nearly all of that ninety percent is private.
Sentence 24: On the basis of area—that is geography—somewhere around eighteen percent of the area of the country could be—not is, but could be—served from Government power plants as they have been already built or are laid down.
Sentence 25: Q. Is that in addition to the ten percent?
Sentence 26: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 27: Oh, no.
Sentence 28: It is a different thing.
Sentence 29: The ten percent, Russ [Young], is the amount of power now generated—the total amount is one hundred, and ten percent is now generated from Government plants, the other ninety percent from private plants.
Sentence 30: That is that thing; leave that to one side.
Sentence 31: Now, the area of the country, the geography, the total square miles of the United States, eighteen percent could be—not is, but could be—served from Government plants.
Sentence 32: Q. Built and building?
Sentence 33: THE PRESIDENT: Built and building.
Sentence 34: Q.
Sentence 35: That is actually projected?
Sentence 36: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 37: Yes.
Sentence 38: Then a third thing, which is quite interesting, is that on a population basis in the United States about thirteen percent of the population of the United States could be served from Government plants.
Sentence 39: Now, let us put it the other way around: That means that from eighty to ninety percent of the total area of the United States, the total population of the United States and the total number of kilowatt hours is being served by private utilities.
Sentence 40: MR. MC NINCH:
Sentence 41: And cannot be by Federal.
Sentence 42: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 43: And cannot be by Federal.
Sentence 44: Q.
Sentence 45: Why do you say it cannot be?
Sentence 46: Supposing, eventually, you had regional plans for power production in those areas.
Sentence 47: THE PRESIDENT: That would be a very simple question to put:What hydroelectric development could the Federal Government put in to serve St. Louis?
Q.
Sentence 48: You could use the Mississippi dams?
Sentence 49: THE PRESIDENT: HOW much power comes from the Mississippi dams?
Sentence 50: They are three feet high.
Sentence 51: Q.
Sentence 52: They could be used.
Sentence 53: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 54: Oh, no.
Q. Cahokia is making it cheaper than Keokuk.
Sentence 55: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 56: The total amount of firm power from the Mississippi dams would not run the White House.
Sentence 57: MR. MC NINCH:
Sentence 58: Almost nothing.
Sentence 59: Q. There are other areas, the Gasconade and Current which should be developed.
Sentence 60: I'm just asking—you said, "could not be."
Sentence 61: I am wondering if you went ahead with a tremendous power program.
Sentence 62: THE PRESIDENT: I am not taking into consideration perfectly remote things like the St. Lawrence Waterway.
Sentence 63: We haven't even a treaty with Canada.
Sentence 64: I don't know.
Sentence 65: Q. I wondered how far ahead you are looking?
Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT: I am talking about any present program.
Q.
Sentence 67: Any present program-it would still be between eighty and ninety percent?
Sentence 68: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 69: And, incidentally, another reason why, in all human probability, it won't get beyond the ten to eighteen percent of Government by either area or population or bulk power, is the fact that if any more were developed by Government it would barely maintain that ratio with the new production of private power.
Sentence 70: Do you see?
Sentence 71: That is a very important factor because, taking a practical example, you can take any one of those new dams in the Tennessee Valley, and the chances are that the private power companies will be increasing their output in the same proportion if one of those new dams comes in.
Sentence 72: Frank, have you got that paper of yours about the Tennessee Valley?
Sentence 73: I think it is rather interesting.
Sentence 74: [Mr. McNinch gave the President some papers.
Sentence 75: ]
Take the Tennessee Power Company, starting in the year 1933—this is the sale, actual sale of power to ultimate consumers it was 2,271,000,000 in 1933.
Sentence 76: Q.
Sentence 77: What is that, horsepower or kilowatt hours?
Sentence 78: THE PRESIDENT: That is kilowatt hours.
Sentence 79: In 1934 it was 2,356,000,000; in 1935 it was 2,683,000,000; in 1936 it was 3,269,000,000; or an increase in the sales of the Tennessee Power Company of 44 percent in four years.
Sentence 80: Q. Mr. President, wasn't some of that due to the general increase of business activity and production?
Sentence 81: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 82: Sure, of course.
Sentence 83: And, as you know, that goes along.
Sentence 84: Q. Has there been a similar increase in installed capacity?
Sentence 85: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 86: Yes.
Sentence 87: In installed capacity they have gone from 3,021,000,000 —
MR. MC NINCH:
Sentence 88: That is generation.
Sentence 89: THE PRESIDENT: This is generating energy, from 3,021,000,000 in 1933 to 4,072,000,000 in 1936.
Sentence 90: I will give you the other figure.
Sentence 91: On revenue—this is in dollars-I might just as well make these round figures, unless you want it down to the dollars?
Sentence 92: Q. No, sir.
Sentence 93: THE PRESIDENT; In 1933, the Tennessee Power Company sold $54,000,000; in 1934, $56,000,000; in 1935, $60,000,000; in 1936, $67,000,000.
Sentence 94: Q. Mr. President, has Government power entered as a competitive factor in there?
Sentence 95: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 96: Surely.
Sentence 97: Q. To what extent?
Sentence 98: THE PRESIDENT: It started in 1933 when we took over the Wilson Dam.
Sentence 99: Q.
Sentence 100: Has your increase been proportionately greater than the private power company?
Sentence 101: I suppose it would be.
Sentence 102: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 103: Oh, surely, because we started from scratch; we started from zero.
Sentence 104: Q.
Sentence 105: Can you tell us to what extent Government has affected this in dollars or revenue?
Sentence 106: THE PRESIDENT: I don't know.
Sentence 107: In other words, you take this one company which, from the point of view of the utility companies, is the worst hit.
Sentence 108: Q. Is this the Commonwealth g: Southern?
Sentence 109: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 110: One of them, the Tennessee Power Company.
Sentence 111: Q. I understood you to say a moment ago that eighteen percent would seem to be the total limit of government competition with the private plants.
Sentence 112: THE PRESIDENT: That is the geographical area and thirteen percent on a population basis and ten to fifteen percent on kilowatts.
Sentence 113: Q. Did you give those figures to Mr. Willkie?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 114: Yes.
Sentence 115: Q.
Sentence 116: What was his reaction?
Sentence 117: Amazement?
Sentence 118: Did he know about that?
Sentence 119: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 120: No, I don't think he did.
Sentence 121: I did not give him those figures there because we do not get to them—I gave him population, geography and total kilowatts.
Sentence 122: Q.
Sentence 123: The other conference about the building program, how did Mr. Willkie react to that, sir?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 124: I suppose the easiest way is to put it this way: That there is this crying need for more power and that the difficulty, Mr. Willkie said, is in raising the junior money.
Sentence 125: I said, "Where?"
Sentence 126: Well, we picked an area many hundred miles removed from the Tennessee Valley, in other words, so far removed that Tennessee Valley power would not enter into it.
Sentence 127: It is an area in which there is no water power.
Sentence 128: I said, "What is to stop the company out in that area from going ahead and adding to its power generation?
Sentence 129: It needs to."
Sentence 130: "Well," he said, "the general feeling.
Sentence 131: "
I said, "The Government isn't in that area in any shape, manner or form," and, quite frankly, the only answer I got was, "the general feeling.
Sentence 132: "
I said, "The Government not only hasn't gone in and has no plans for going in, but how could it go in?"
"Well," he said, "the general feeling."
Sentence 133: Well, that seems to be the difficulty.
Sentence 134: Q. Meaning that the general feeling that the Government would go in would prohibit them from floating the junior securities?
Sentence 135: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 136: Yes.
Sentence 137: Q. Didn't he mean the general feeling of timidity and uncertainty on the part of the power people at this stage of it?
Sentence 138: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 139: He said they couldn't sell the securities.
Sentence 140: I said,"Has any effort been made?"
Sentence 141: He said, "No."
Q. What did he say to that, when you asked him had any effort been made?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 142: Well, he said, "It is impossible.
Sentence 143: "
Q. Did you find yourselves in sharp disagreement on any of these important matters?
Sentence 144: THE PRESIDENT: Not the major principles, no.
Sentence 145: I asked various other leading questions which I cannot tell you about at the present time very well because—Oh, I mean they related- well, just as an example, would a utility recognize that common stock should be limited to the reasonable returns set out by the common law, seven or eight percent?
Sentence 146: That is a matter that is still open because the determination of that answer would solve a great many troubles.
Sentence 147: Q. Did you discuss the possible repeal of the death sentence?
Sentence 148: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 149: No.
Q. Did he advance or indicate in any way how that general feeling could be changed?
Sentence 150: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 151: He gave me, as he went out, a memorandum which I have not had the opportunity to read.
Sentence 152: Q. That seems to be the general thought that he was expressing, what all writers and stockbrokers say, as to the general feeling.
Sentence 153: So I would think the natural thing would be for him to say
Sentence 154: that if you did this or that—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 155: He did not get to that.
Sentence 156: Q. Did he confine his definition of general feeling or his idea of general feeling to the utility problem itself?
Sentence 157: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 158: Oh, yes; we only talked about that, that is all.
Sentence 159: Q. Did you discover that Mr. Willkie or any of these utility people are at all reconciled to Government competition in the power field?
Sentence 160: Are they still feeling that the Government is their enemy when it comes to generating and selling power?
Sentence 161: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 162: Well, Fred [Essary], I don't know how to answer that.
Sentence 163: I said, "Do you think the Government should sell no power from these plants?"
Sentence 164: He said, "Yes, they should sell.
Sentence 165: "
Q. Don't they want to purchase at the switchboard so they can distribute?
Sentence 166: That is what they always asked for.
Sentence 167: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 168: Yes, I suppose so.
Sentence 169: We did not talk about that.
Sentence 170: Q.
Sentence 171: You did not talk?
Sentence 172: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Sentence 173: Q.
Sentence 174: That is what they have always said, "Give us the power at the switchboard and don't have any limitation over our means of distribution.
Sentence 175: "
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 176: Yes.
Sentence 177: Q. Could you say, from your general conversations with Mr: Willkie, and his reaction and your reaction, that some headway is being made with this problem?
Sentence 178: THE PRESIDENT: I should say so, wouldn't you, Frank?
MR. MC NINCH:
Sentence 179: Yes.
Sentence 180: THE PRESIDENT: Very distinctly.
Sentence 181: Q.
Sentence 182: You put this proposition of dividends up to him?
Sentence 183: THE PRESIDENT: I would not say that—We talked about that purely as theory.
Sentence 184: Nothing was put up by either side.
Sentence 185: We have been talking theory today and we shall continue to talk theory for some time to come.
Sentence 186: There is nothing concrete, no suggestions that the company do this or the Government do that.
Sentence 187: Q. Where is the headway being made?
THE PRESIDENT: The fact that we are getting down to some of these fundamentals.
Sentence 188: Q.
Sentence 189: You are agreed on certain factors?
Sentence 190: THE PRESIDENT: I talked, for instance, of the famous case in the northeastern part of the country where a little private company had a little strip of territory, about twenty miles wide and forty or fifty miles long.
Sentence 191: They had their own private development, two or three villages, all local capital, and the total amount of money was $250,000.
Sentence 192: They just had one line that served these two or three villages and ran up the highway a bit.
Sentence 193: You could not even call it rural distribution.
Sentence 194: They were doing very nicely, making about 8 percent on their money right along, paying it out to themselves.
Sentence 195: Finally, two of these big boys came in competing for the territory and the bidding started at half a million, threequarters of a million, a million, and finally they could not stand the gaff any longer and they took a 500 percent profit.
Sentence 196: They sold out for a million and a quarter.
Sentence 197: "Well," I said, "should that million and a quarter enter into the rate base of the purchasing company or should it be $250,000, which is what the whole thing had cost them?"
Sentence 198: He said, "No, certainly not.
Sentence 199: It should be $250,000."
Sentence 200: Now, we are getting somewhere, when we begin talking like that.
Sentence 201: Q.
Sentence 202: They can take that to court and get a million and a quarter.
Sentence 203: THE PRESIDENT: We are getting somewhere, never mind.
Sentence 204: Q. Did you discuss holding companies with him at all?
Sentence 205: THE PRESIDENT: Barely scratched the surface.
Sentence 206: Q. Going on with that example, you cited one exactly parallel in the Press Conference the other day.
Sentence 207: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 208: Yes.
Q.
Sentence 209: And you said we are going back to the old English common law.
Sentence 210: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 211: Yes.
Sentence 212: Q.
Sentence 213: So, in effect, Mr. Willkie agreed with your theory of valuation?
Sentence 214: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 215: Yes.
Sentence 216: Wouldn't you say so?
MR. MC NINCH; He proposed, he said he would be entirely agree-able to have all the write-ups discovered by the Federal Trade Commission and reported by them taken out of the capital structures generally.
Sentence 217: Q. Was that the old common law way of figuring?
Sentence 218: Q.
Sentence 219: That is a concession in itself.
Sentence 220: Q. Would you remind repeating it?
Sentence 221: MR. MC NINCH:
Sentence 222: He would be agreeable to adopting the Federal Trade Commission report and eliminating all the write-ups that it found in those systems.
Sentence 223: THE PRESIDENT: When were those reports made?
MR. MC NINCH:
Sentence 224: They were completed in 1935.
Sentence 225: I believe they went over a period of three or four or five years.
Sentence 226: The suggestion was made by me that they did cover a considerable percentage of the industry but not all.
Sentence 227: They did not examine the whole industry but they did examine the larger set-ups.
Sentence 228: They covered 68 or 70 percent of the total investment.
Sentence 229: Q. How much water would be squeezed out of those you did know?
Sentence 230: Did you ever compute that?
MR. MC NINCH:
Sentence 231: Yes.
Sentence 232: I will get it in a moment.
Sentence 233: Q. How did this New York report happen to reach you?
Sentence 234: Was there some provision that it should be delivered to the President?
Sentence 235: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 236: Yes.
Q.
Sentence 237: It was made on the State authorization?
Sentence 238: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 239: Yes.
Q.
Sentence 240: And delivered to the President?
Sentence 241: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 242: And made to me because it is, of course, of definite interest to those five groups that I sent it to, the three Committees on the Hill and the Federal Power Commission and the National Resources Committee.
Sentence 243: Q.
Sentence 244: And it is also made to the Governor of the State of New York, I presume?
Sentence 245: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 246: Yes.
Sentence 247: Q. How did it happen to be released just now, at this time?
Sentence 248: THE PRESIDENT: Because Frank Walsh brought it in yesterday.
Sentence 249: I did not know when he was coming.
Sentence 250: Q.
Sentence 251: That won't complicate this attempt to get together?
Sentence 252: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 253: Oh, no.
Sentence 254: In fact, it ought to help because there we have figures one way and figures another way.
Sentence 255: It ought to be extremely helpful.
Sentence 256: The public is entitled to both figures, as I said in my letter transmitting it, and these figures deserve at least as wide publication as the previous set of figures. . .
Sentence 257: .
Sentence 258: Q. Have you any assurance that Mr. Willkie is speaking for the entire industry?
Sentence 259: THE PRESIDENT: Not for a minute.
Sentence 260: Q.
Sentence 261: Because I cannot imagine the Associated Gas 8c Electric.
Sentence 262: THE PRESIDENT: Not for a minute.
Sentence 263: Q. Have you anything on housing?
Sentence 264: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 265: In just a minute.
Sentence 266: I want to read this telegram that came in.
Sentence 267: Harry J. Bauer was here in Washington last week—
MR. MC NINCH:
Sentence 268: The day before the date of that telegram.
Sentence 269: THE PRESIDENT: —and I expected to see him, but being laid up with a bad tooth I could not see him.
Sentence 270: I think he has gone back to Los Angeles but I expect to see him the next time.
Sentence 271: Q.
Sentence 272: Who is he?
MR. MC NINCH:
Sentence 273: President of the Southern California Edison Company.
Sentence 274: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 275: He sent this telegram to Chairman McNinch, which I think is rather interesting.
Sentence 276: If you want copies I see no reason why you should not have copies.
Sentence 277: (Reading) "Will you please express to the President my sincere appreciation of the honor of being invited to attend the conference of the utility executives to be held at the White House today and also my regret that it is impossible for me to be present.
Sentence 278: Should you feel that my ideas would be of any interest to the President, will you please advise the President that our company has lived successfully for many years in competition with the yardstick afforded by the municipally operated plants in our territory—that we have successfully met this competition by progressive measures such as basing our rates on historic cost rather than on reproduction cost and that of making rates as low as possible rather than merely reasonable, thus avoiding the necessity for rate regulation by the Railroad Commission of the State of California—that we have been and are continually reducing rates voluntarily, our first consideration always being that of our consumers, that as a result of this policy our company has not had a general rate hearing before the Railroad Commission since 1922—that our general policy concerning rates can be stated as follows: 'Rates should be as low as possible, thereby anticipating, one, competition, two, regulation, three, the economic necessity of the consumer, and, fourth, the reasonable expectations of the consumer.
Sentence 279: Our company has greatly benefited by the President's policy, particularly with reference to low cost of money, and, secondly, by the greater interest in the use of electricity which national publicity has created in the minds of the consumers.
Sentence 280: I am sending this message to you rather than directly to the President so that such attention will be given it as you think it deserves.
Sentence 281: "
Q. You answered a question that you doubted whether you could do this before you got away.
Sentence 282: Have you any idea as to when you will be able to get away?
Sentence 283: THE PRESIDENT: As soon as they stop treating my bad tooth because I don't want to take the dentist with me.
Sentence 284: This is a guess on my part but it will be either Saturday night or Sunday night, but entirely subject to the treatment.
Sentence 285: Q.
Sentence 286: In my capacity, I have a question to ask for a young lady reporter, Miss Craig.
Sentence 287: She asked me to ask you which tooth it was and have you lost your beautiful smile as a result of it and what became of the tooth.
Sentence 288: (Laughter)
Q. Is it a tooth or a cave?
Sentence 289: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 290: Well, on the first, the location: It is in Number 3 hole, aft, on the starboard side.
Sentence 291: (Laughter)
Q. How about the beautiful smile?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 292: Oh, judge for yourself, sweetness.
Sentence 293: Q.
Sentence 294: What was the other—who got the tooth?
Sentence 295: THE PRESIDENT: I think I will probably make that announcement at the Gridiron Dinner.
Sentence 296: Q. Getting back to housing, have you come to any decision on annual wage for labor?
Sentence 297: THE PRESIDENT: No.
Q.
Sentence 298: Apparently the prices of materials have gone down of their own accord, if the recession continues—
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 299: In some lines, not all.
Sentence 300: Q. Are they still going up?
Sentence 301: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 302: The last advice I had was that lumber has taken a very definite drop.
Sentence 303: Cement, about which there has been a great deal of complaint about price maintenance, not by agreement but by hypnosis, that hasn't gone down.
Sentence 304: Steel hasn't gone down.
Sentence 305: There is competition in lumber and that has gone down.
Sentence 306: Q. On this question of recession—have you—put it this way: Do your Government advices coincide with the New York Times index which seems to be rather alarming?
THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 307: I don't know.
Sentence 308: I have not had any of the consolidated indices we get now.
Sentence 309: Q.
Sentence 310: I was wondering whether the statistical bureau is supplying you.
Sentence 311: THE PRESIDENT: It still is—the Central Statistical Bureau—but I haven't seen anything for about three weeks.
Sentence 312: Q. Does the type of wage and hour bills for which the labor leaders are asking conform with your ideas?
Sentence 313: THE PRESIDENT: I don't know.
Sentence 314: On the question of the wages and hours and the crop bills, I have been very much amused, sitting here with nothing very much to do in the morning except to read the paper, to see all the various stories about this being an Administration proposal and that being the President's proposal, and this being thrown out and that being accepted, et cetera.
Sentence 315: The only thing I can obviously say is what I said last Spring, that I would send a message outlining objectives.
Sentence 316: I sent two, one in the Spring on wages and hours and one the other day on wages and hours.
Sentence 317: The easiest answer is to tell you to read the messages.
Sentence 318: One of you may decide that X bill does not conform and that Y bill does conform, but it is just your guess.
Sentence 319: It may be good and it may not be.
Sentence 320: Q.
Sentence 321: In your leisure hours last night, did you listen to Arthur Vandenberg?
Sentence 322: THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 323: No. Was he on the air?
Sentence 324: Q.
Sentence 325: Yes, he was on the air.
Sentence 326: MR. EARLY:
Sentence 327: He is in the Star tonight, boss.
Sentence 328: Q.
Sentence 329: He quoted you as saying, when you were at Charleston, two years ago, that prosperity came because you had planned it that way, and he pointed out that you said the other day that business can do more than the Administration can on securing it.
Sentence 330: He said you were right the first time.
Sentence 331: In other words, that the policies of government had brought this along.
Sentence 332: THE PRESIDENT: I cannot comment in answer to Arthur, obviously.
Sentence 333: As long as you do not tie this in in any way with Arthur, that was perfectly true in Charleston in 1935.
Sentence 334: The things we had done, which at that time were largely a monetary and pump-priming policy for two years and a half, had brought the expected result, perfectly definitely.
Sentence 335: That, of course, has absolutely nothing to do with the present situation because the monetary medicine that was given worked and there was no more monetary medicine given.
Sentence 336: On the pump-priming, we have gradually come to an end or, rather, a great diminution of pump-priming.
Sentence 337: Then, of course, there was the third factor, an important factor.
Sentence 338: The time was just after the NRA decision.
Sentence 339: Wages and hours were all right, especially wages.
Sentence 340: There was also the getting together of industry every month around a table, industry by industry, where they went over the old-fashioned law of supply and demand: "Is there too much of a surplus at the present time?
Sentence 341: Should we slow up?"
That was knocked into a cocked hat.
Sentence 342: Subsequently, in January, 2936, came the other factor, which was the knocking out of Triple A, which was working on the general control of unwieldy surpluses.
Sentence 343: Today we 'are suffering, in the cotton industry, from a condition which would not have been nearly as bad if the Triple A had been in effect this past growing season.
Sentence 344: Q. Anything to be said on the international situation?
Sentence 345: Anything ahead that can be foreseen?
Sentence 346: THE PRESIDENT: I don't think so, Fred
Sentence 347: [Essary].
Sentence 348: I haven't seen today's dispatches.
Sentence 349: Q.
Sentence 350: They seem to have recessed in Brussels subject to call of the Chair.
Sentence 351: THE PRESIDENT: I think the only thing you can do would be to intimate that efforts made at seeking ways towards peace will, of course, continue at every possible opportunity.
Sentence 352: That is the policy of the Government—to seek every possible means towards peace, both in relation to existing situations and future dangers—to keep on trying.
Sentence 353: If you don't succeed at first, keep right on trying.
Sentence 354: Well, I hope to be over on Friday.
Sentence 355: Q. Have you any plans for Thanksgiving?
Sentence 356: THE PRESIDENT: Just a family dinner, that is all.
