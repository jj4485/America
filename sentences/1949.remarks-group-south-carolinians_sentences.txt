Sentence 1: 1949 Remarks Group South Carolinians

Ladies and gentlemen, and distinguished Members of the Congress from South Carolina:
Sentence 2: It certainly is a most cordial invitation which you have given to me, and one which it would be exceedingly hard to refuse.
Sentence 3: I hope that some time when business is not so pressing on me as it is at present that I may pay another visit to South Carolina.
Sentence 4: I have been there many a time.
Sentence 5: I was there at an azalea festival with John Garner, and I have been there on several other occasions, when I didn't attract so much attention as I do now; and I enjoyed the visits every time.
Sentence 6: People are naturally hospitable and cordial.
Sentence 7: I am very happy to have you here and to meet each and every one of you.
Sentence 8: I hope that you will do me the favor of allowing me to shake hands with you as a group, for the simple reason that I have several delegations coming in today--more than usual.
Sentence 9: As you know, I shake hands with 30 or 40,000 people every year.
Sentence 10: Last year I shook hands with 200,000, and the arm's getting kinda tired.
Sentence 11: So, if you will allow me to shake hands with you collectively instead of individually, I will consider it a personal favor.
Sentence 12: And I will count that in your favor when I go to make up my mind as to whether I will come or not.
Sentence 13: Thank you very much.
