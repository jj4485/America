Sentence 1: 1950 The Presidents News Conference 628

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: Please be seated.
Sentence 3: I understand that these photographers are going to be here about 3 minutes
Sentence 4: and then they will leave.
Sentence 5: They just want to see what this place looks like.
Sentence 6: [1.]
Sentence 7: I have got a statement I would like to read to you before we start on the question period.
Sentence 8: "Mr. Schuman's
1
proposal"--this is mimeographed and will be ready for distribution when you go out--"for the pooling of the French and German steel and coal industries is an act of constructive statesmanship.
Sentence 9: We welcome it.
Sentence 10: This demonstration of French leadership in the solution of the problems of Europe is in the great French tradition.
Sentence 11: The wholehearted reception of this proposal in Germany is likewise encouraging.
Sentence 12: 1
Robert Schuman, French Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Sentence 13: "This proposal provides the basis for establishing an entirely new relationship between France and Germany, and opens a new outlook for Europe.
Sentence 14: There will be many difficult problems to solve in developing this far-reaching plan.
Sentence 15: I am confident, however, that the kind of imaginative thinking that went into the proposal can work out the details in ways that will benefit not only the countries directly concerned, including those who work in these industries and those who use their products, but also the whole free world.
Sentence 16: "We are gratified at the emphasis the proposal places upon equal access to coal and steel products to all Western European countries, and upon the need for reductions in cost, through higher productivity, so that consumers can benefit through lower prices and workers through higher wages.
Sentence 17: We are also gratified to note, while the proposal protects the coal and steel industries against the shocks of readjustment during the transitional period, it does leave the industry open to receive, once the transition is completed, the full benefits of the competitive process.
Sentence 18: That will be ready for your use as soon as we get through here.
Sentence 19: [2.]
Sentence 20: Q. Mr. President, you have talked to us before on the subject, but I wonder if you could tell us what you make now of the continuing trouble that the reorganization plans
2
are having?
Sentence 21: They have disapproved four in recent days.
Sentence 22: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 23: Well, it's a legislative--
2 See Items 53-76, and 112-115.
Sentence 24: Q. Mr. President, we can't hear back here.
Sentence 25: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 26: All right, we'll yell a little louder.
Sentence 27: It's a legislative prerogative to vote against every tax bill and to vote for every appropriation.
Sentence 28: It is also a legislative prerogative to continually talk about efficiency and economy, but to be very careful that efficiency and economy does not in any way get rid of any people in whom they are personally interested, or that no appropriation is cut off that in any way affects the local situation.
Sentence 29: I think that is all that is the matter with it.
Sentence 30: I think you will remember that these reorganization authorizations have been in existence I think nearly ever since I came to the Senate.
Sentence 31: And President Roosevelt had a bill that was almost unworkable.
Sentence 32: I inherited one that had 12 exceptions in it.
Sentence 33: And when we appointed the bipartisan commission to go into the thing in detail, they issued a five-volume report like that--[indicating].
Sentence 34: I am taking that report for what it means, and I am sending down reorganization plans, and shall continue to send them down, as long as that authorization bill is in effect.
Sentence 35: It is the privilege of the Congress to act on them in any way they see fit.
Sentence 36: Q. Mr. President, will you comment on Senator McClellan's charge that you are using those reorganization proposals as an excuse for a power grab--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 37: The only comment I can make is that it just isn't true.
Sentence 38: [3.]
Sentence 39: Q. Mr. President, what do you think of the arguments of some Senators that the FEPC bill is Communist in origin?
Sentence 40: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 41: Well, I think I have made myself perfectly clear on the FEPC bill, and I don't think that deserves any comment.
Sentence 42: [4.]
Sentence 43: Q. Mr. President, you said that your basic program has been blocked in Congress by various oddly assorted groups, and that you hoped by next January that some of the worst obstructionists would be removed from the Congress.
Sentence 44: Did you mean to distinguish between parties--between Democratic and Republican obstructionists in that speech?
Sentence 45: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 46: No, I didn't.
Sentence 47: Q. Could you tell us some of the obstructionists you mean?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 48: No, I cannot.
Sentence 49: You know them as well as I do.
Sentence 50: All you have got to do is go down there and read the record.
Sentence 51: [5.]
Sentence 52: Q. Mr. President, the Export-Import Bank yesterday announced a credit of $125 million to a consortium of Argentine banks.
Sentence 53: Do you wish to comment any further about that?
Sentence 54: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 55: No, I have no comment on it.
Sentence 56: I think it is a good loan.
Sentence 57: [6.]
Sentence 58: Q. Mr. President, do I understand you to mean that everybody who votes against your proposed program is an obstructionist and should be defeated?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 59: Oh no--you don't put any meaning like that on it.
Sentence 60: An obstructionist is a man who is against everything that is for the welfare of the people.
Sentence 61: He doesn't have to be--he is not an obstructionist if he has some pet thing that he doesn't like.
Sentence 62: I don't expect all the Members of the Congress ever to go along completely on what I am asking them to do.
Sentence 63: That is what the Congress is for.
Sentence 64: I want a Congress--an absolutely independent Congress, but people who are against everything certainly do not belong in this age.
Sentence 65: Q.
Sentence 66: You mean it's a matter of degree?
Sentence 67: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 68: Yes, it's a matter of degree entirely.
Sentence 69: [7.]
Sentence 70: Q. Mr. President, this morning I received a premium notice from one of America's largest mutual life insurance companies, and enclosed was what was purported to be a personal letter from the president--no doubt addressed to a couple of million policyholders--complaining of deficits and governmental spending, and urging that I immediately protest to my Congressman.
Sentence 71: I also noted, with pleasure, that during the past year, and no doubt due to most excellent management, the company had piled up such a huge surplus that my dividends for the year cut down my premium by twothirds!
Sentence 72: Have you any comment, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 73: Well, nobody feels any stronger than I do about deficit financing of any sort; and if you will read my three veto messages to the 80th Congress on that inane tax bill that they passed, you will find the reason for the deficit.
Sentence 74: The deficit is not alarming.
Sentence 75: It will be worked out, and we will eventually balance the budget.
Sentence 76: What we are trying to do now is to prevent another war.
Sentence 77: [8.]
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, the Ambassador to Chile, Mr. Bowers, was in to see you this morning, and he said that he urged you to visit Chile in November and visit the steel plant down there.
Sentence 79: Could you tell us if you will make that trip, or whether you think you can go or not?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 80: I told the Ambassador that I of course would like to come to Chile.
Sentence 81: I always have wanted to come to Chile, but I can make no definite plans now that far in advance on a trip of that sort.
Sentence 82: [9.]
Sentence 83: Q. Speaking of tax bills, what do you think of the one they are working up for you in the House?
Sentence 84: Do you have any comment on the part that concerns capital gains?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 85: I can't comment on bills when they are in the course of preparation.
Sentence 86: The only time I can comment intelligently is after the bill gets to me, after having passed the House and the Senate.
Sentence 87: [10.]
Sentence 88: Q. Mr. President, is your decision to close the Birmingham Veterans Hospital at Van Nuys, Calif., final?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: I didn't understand the question.
Sentence 90: Q. Is your decision to close the Birmingham Veterans Hospital final?
Sentence 91: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 92: The decision was made in conjunction with the Veterans Administration, and it is final.
Sentence 93: [11.]
Sentence 94: Q. Mr. President, as of last Sunday, the Washington Post reported that you had not been asked a single question on McCarthy on your trip.
Sentence 95: Do you have an explanation for that?
Sentence 96: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: Not a single one.
Sentence 98: And I have no explanation.
Sentence 99: I think it explains itself.
Sentence 100: [12.]
Sentence 101: Q. Mr. President, Secretary Johnson is going to Japan, and the story is that he is going to investigate the prospect of a peace treaty.
Sentence 102: Is that within his province?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 103: Secretary Johnson is going to the Far East on the same sort of military errand that he went to Belgium on.
Sentence 104: The peace treaty will be negotiated in the regular manner by the Secretary of State when the time is propitious for that purpose, and I hope that won't be too far off.
Sentence 105: [13.]
Sentence 106: Q. Mr. President, on your trip West, did you find people as responsive in 1950 as they were in 1948, sir?
Sentence 107: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 108: Oh, yes.
Sentence 109: If you will consult these gentlemen right around here that went with me, they can tell you all about it.
Sentence 110: [Laughter]
Sentence 111: [14.]
Sentence 112: Q. Mr. President, have you made a decision on the application of the Czech delegate to the United Nations for asylum in this country ?
Sentence 113: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 114: The matter has been referred to the State Department.
Sentence 115: [15.]
Sentence 116: Q. I didn't understand that McCarthy question--what was that question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 117: Platform crowds--platform crowds on the trip, that is what was referred to.
Sentence 118: [16.]
Sentence 119: Q. Mr. President, pardon me for asking the same sort of question, but there is some confusion on that Argentine question.
Sentence 120: Do you make some distinction between a credit and a loan?
Sentence 121: I merely wanted to ask if you use the word "loan" advisedly or whether you merely referred to the approval of a credit?
Sentence 122: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 123: I don't see any difference between a credit and a loan.
Sentence 124: The bank usually gives me the power to draw a certain amount of money on a check.
Sentence 125: Whether it is signed as a note or whether they accept my check on an overdraft, I think that is a loan just the same.
Sentence 126: [17.]
Sentence 127: Q. Mr. President, I wrote one of my hands out on the trip.
Sentence 128: When you said that--speaking of the reorganization bills-you said it is a legislative prerogative to vote against every--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 129: To vote against tax bills and to vote for appropriations.
Sentence 130: Don't you know that is the way a Congressman gets reelected?
Sentence 131: Never vote for a tax bill and never vote against an appropriation.
Sentence 132: [18.]
Sentence 133: Q. Also, I don't know whether you heard about Senator Brewster, who announced today that John W. Hanes--whom he called an outstanding Democrat--had taken up or paid the check of Mr. Victor Johnston on the Chicago trip.
Sentence 134: 3
I wonder if you had any comment on that?
Sentence 135: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 136: No, I have no comment on that.
Sentence 137: Senator Brewster ought to know.
Sentence 138: He is on the Republican committee that handles those things.
Sentence 139: 3 Senator Owen Brewster of Maine, chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, quoted the poem that the President had recited during his address at Chicago (Item 134) and added that the Committee had sent an observer, Victor A. Johnston, a Committee employee, to follow the President during his trip through the West.
Sentence 140: Senator Brewster added that the cost of the plane which carried Mr. Johnston had been met by John W. Hanes, vice chairman of the Republican National Finance Committee and Under Secretary of the Treasury during the Roosevelt administration.
Sentence 141: (See Congressional Record, vol. 96, p. 7197.)
Sentence 142: Q.
Sentence 143: He announced it.
Sentence 144: I just wanted your reaction on his--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: I say he ought to know.
Sentence 146: He is on that committee.
Sentence 147: Q. Mr. President, do you think that Mr. Hanes got his money's worth?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 148: Read Tony Leviero's letter to Johnston to take back to his people, I think that answers it.
Sentence 149: 4
4 An article by Anthony H. Leviero, which appeared in the May 14 edition of the New York Times, was written in the form of an imaginary letter from Mr. Johnston and his traveling companion, Philip Willkie, to his Republican superiors in Washington.
Sentence 150: The "letter" stated that the President was drawing large and apparently friendly crowds at the various whistlestops he visited and that what sounded like socialism in Washington had a different meaning for the people of the communities who felt they had received benefits in the form of public power and similar enterprises.
Sentence 151: [19.]
Sentence 152: Q. Mr. President, there are reports this morning from Paris that Great Britain has agreed to join in the European pact.
Sentence 153: Do you have any further information on it, or comment?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 154: No, I haven't, and I have no information on it.
Sentence 155: [20.]
Sentence 156: Q. Do you have any comment on the defeat of the Grundy forces in Pennsylvania?
5
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 157: I imagine that Mr. Duff is very happy.
Sentence 158: [Laughter]
5 In the Pennsylvania Republican primary election held on May 16, Governor James H. Duff won the Republican nomination for Senator by defeating Representative John C. Kunkel.
Sentence 159: Representative Kunkel was allied with the political forces of former Senator Joseph R. Grundy.
Sentence 160: [21.]
Sentence 161: Q. Mr. President, how do you reconcile Dr. Keyserling' sending a committee to New England to study unemployment there with the complaints of New England Congressmen that lack of tariff protection and foreign competition is ruining the New England industries?
Sentence 162: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 163: I don't think that is what is ruining New England at all.
Sentence 164: And when Keyserling gets through, I will tell you what it is.
Sentence 165: 6
6
On May 15 the White House announced that Dr. Leon H. Keyserling, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, had requested seven New England economists to serve as a committee of experts to study the causes of unemployment in certain New England cities.
Sentence 166: The study resulted in a report entitled "The New England Economy: A Report to the President Transmitting a Study Initiated by the Council of Economic Advisers and Prepared by Its Committee on the New England Economy" (Government Printing Office, 205 pp., 1951).
Sentence 167: Q.
Sentence 168: Do you know now?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 169: No, I don't, but I will tell you when I find out.
Sentence 170: [22.]
Sentence 171: Q. Mr. President, to bring this down to a local level, at the time that the District of Columbia decided to celebrate its 150th birthday a few months back, you explained you were in favor of the idea of a freedom fair.
Sentence 172: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 173: That's right.
Sentence 174: Q.
Sentence 175: As it has run into a kind of "rhubarb" now--being tossed back and forth--the status of the freedom fair is somewhat in doubt.
Sentence 176: Would you like to comment on that?
Sentence 177: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 178: Well, I was informed by Carter Barron that a subcommittee on the celebration--sesquicentennial committee, I think they call it--of which I am the honorary chairman--had recommended that it be abandoned.
Sentence 179: Carter expressed the idea that it probably would be abandoned, for the simple reason that the people of the District of Columbia seem not to be very much interested in it; and I am sorry to report that that is a fact.
Sentence 180: The Congress has been violently opposed to it--had an awful time getting the appropriation, even to start the celebration for the sesquicentennial.
Sentence 181: The local people here seem not to be interested in it at all, and it wouldn't surprise me if that thing--that fair is not abandoned.
Sentence 182: 7

See Item 77.
Sentence 183: [23.]
Sentence 184: Q. Mr. President, I wonder if you plan to help Senator Olin Johnston of South Carolina get reelected this year?
Sentence 185: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 186: I am not dabbling in South Carolina politics right now.
Sentence 187: [24.]
Sentence 188: Q. Mr. President, you said that you imagined that Mr. Duff is very happy about the defeat of the Grundy forces.
Sentence 189: I wonder if you are very happy about it?
Sentence 190: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 191: Let's wait until November, and I will tell you whether I am happy or not.
Sentence 192: [Laughter]
Q. As late as November, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 193: Yes, it will take until after the first Tuesday in November before I can tell you.
Sentence 194: I am for the Democrats, you understand.
Sentence 195: [More laughter]
Sentence 196: [25.]
Sentence 197: Q. Mr. President, do you care to comment on Senator Taft's charge that your administration contains political immorality?
Sentence 198: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 199: No.
Sentence 200: No, I don't care to comment, thank you.
Sentence 201: The Tribune will comment on that all that is necessary.
Sentence 202: [Laughter]
Sentence 203: [26.]
Sentence 204: Q. Mr. President, the Chicago Tribune the other day said that the goodneighbor policy was aimed at robbing South American states.
Sentence 205: At the same time, almost, a former collaborator of former Secretary Byrnes in Havana--the Uruguayan Senator Larreta
8
said that the inter-American system at present under the Bogota Charter encourages dictatorship.
Sentence 206: Would you care to comment on both of those statements?
Sentence 207: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 208: No comment, because I don't think there is anything to either one of them.
Sentence 209: 8
Eduardo Rodriguez Larreta.
Sentence 210: [27.]
Sentence 211: Q. Mr. President, you listened to Herbert Hoover's speech on the radio recently.
Sentence 212: I wonder if you had listened to Taft's?
Sentence 213: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 214: No, I didn't listen to Taft.
Sentence 215: I went to sleep that night.
Sentence 216: I had been up quite a bit, you know, for the week previously.
Sentence 217: I didn't listen to the speech, and I haven't read it, I am sorry to say.
Sentence 218: Reporter:
Sentence 219: Thank you, Mr. President.
