Item 77.

Sentence 88: It wasn't a Russian that slipped in that veto, was it?

Sentence 89: NO.
Sentence 90: Here is the memorandum from the Attorney General, and you can get this outside later, if you want it.
Sentence 91: [Reading] "With reference to your inquiry concerning your veto of Senate Joint Resolution 97, I beg to advise:
"The inclusion in the veto message, prepared in the Department, of language stating that 'this type of legislation is novel' is incorrect.
Sentence 92: Further investigation has disclosed that similar language has been included in previous resolutions.
Sentence 93: "There is no question that sections 361, 365, and 366 of the revised statutes did not have to be included in the resolution to accomplish the objective of the sponsor of the resolution.
Sentence 94: These sections deal with the attorneys in the Department of Justice and those who represent the United States in litigation.
Sentence 95: In view of this fact, it was my thought that these three sections were inadvertently included in the resolution when it was originally drafted.
Sentence 96: Certainly this inclusion might be interpreted as an effort to grant authority to the committee counsel to initiate civil or criminal proceedings on behalf of the United States.
Sentence 97: This duty, as you know, has been placed in the Department of Justice by the Congress.
Sentence 98: I am sure that the Congress had no intention in this resolution to change this long established practice and the inclusion of these three sections certainly is subject to that interpretation.
Sentence 99: "For these reasons, in my opinion, the resolution was properly vetoed."
Sentence 100: That is signed by the Attorney General.
Sentence 101: I want to make it perfectly dear that Senator Wheeler did not enter into this thing at all.
Sentence 102: I have no objection to Senator Wheeler representing that committee or any other committee that he sees fit.
Sentence 103: I have always been very fond of Senator Wheeler.
Sentence 104: He and I were the best of friends while I was in the Senate.
Sentence 105: [15.]
Sentence 106: Q. Mr. President, have you received the resignation of Judge Kimbrough Stone of the 12th--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: I am not ready to make an announcement on that.
Sentence 108: I may be able to make an announcement on it in another week.
Sentence 109: [16.]
Sentence 110: Q. Mr. President, have you any comment to make on Mr. Bowles' suggestion that a special price commission.--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: No comment.
Sentence 112: No, I have no comment.
Sentence 113: [17.]
Sentence 114: Q. Mr. President, has the price situation changed any, one way or another, since your speech Monday ?
1
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 115: All I know is what I see in the papers.
Sentence 116: Seems to be some action being taken in various parts of the country on the subject.
Sentence 117: I am very much pleased with the action of the merchants in Newburyport, Mass., and I notice there are several other instances of similar action which has been taken.
Sentence 118: 1
See Item 76.
Sentence 119: [18.]
Sentence 120: Mr. Ross [to the President]: Judge Latta says that the copper bill is not signed yet.
Sentence 121: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 122: I see.
Sentence 123: On that question about that copper bill, Judge Latta says it has come to the White House, but has not been signed as yet.
Sentence 124: I had a memorandum on it, I know, and I couldn't remember whether I had signed it or not.
Sentence 125: The Judge says I have not signed it.
Sentence 126: Q. Mr. President, will you sign it, sir?
Sentence 127: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 128: I will answer that when it comes to the final decision.
Sentence 129: [19.]
Sentence 130: Q. Mr. President, does that veto affect Senator Wheeler's standing?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: All I know is what I saw in the paper.
Sentence 132: I didn't know it was speculative.
Sentence 133: Q. Mr. President, are you going to do anything to either recall--I understand you can't recall a veto--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 134: Can't recall a veto.
Sentence 135: The proper thing, I imagine, is to pass the resolution without the objectionable sections in it.
Sentence 136: [20.]
Sentence 137: Q. Have you given that Senate committee permission to get those Roosevelt letters on the oil?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 138: I have informed the Senate committee that specific documents that they want from my files I shall always give to them.
Sentence 139: Q. Have they named a specific document yet?
Sentence 140: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 149: Q. Would you favor a price board composed of businessmen to discuss prices ?

Sentence 152: I have made all the discussion on prices that it was necessary to have made, in the speech that I made to the AP in New York.
Sentence 153: That covered the ground so far as I am concerned.
Sentence 154: [23.]
Sentence 155: Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on General Marshall's role in the foreign ministers conference in Moscow?
Sentence 156: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 157: General Marshall will make the comment on that when he gets home.
Sentence 158: Q.
Sentence 159: When do you expect that?
Sentence 160: When will that be?
Sentence 161: Q. Mr. President, is he going to make a speech ?
Sentence 162: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 163: General Marshall will make a report, of course, when he returns home.
Sentence 164: Q.
Sentence 165: When will that be, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 166: I can't answer that.
Sentence 167: Q. Monday or Tuesday night?
Sentence 168: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 169: I can't answer that.
Sentence 170: I don't know.
Sentence 171: [24.]
Sentence 172: Q. Mr. President, may I get clear-my thinking clear on this?
Sentence 173: The veto stands until they change the legislation?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 174: That's right.
Sentence 175: Q.
Sentence 176: You still object to the inclusion of the last sections?
Sentence 177: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 178: The last three sections, yes sir.
Sentence 179: And the first--if you will study the history of the thing, you will find that the first bill of that sort, in which those three sections are included, was necessary.
Sentence 180: The other bills which have been subsequently brought up, with inclusion of the three sections, was not necessary, but they were included just as a matter of form.
Sentence 181: Q. Well, Mr. President, I got the erroneous idea at the Capitol last night then.
Sentence 182: The way they understood it was a suggestion to repass the identical resolution again.
Sentence 183: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 184: I have made no such suggestion at all.
Sentence 185: I have talked to nobody about it except right here now.
Sentence 186: Q. Mr. President, another set of words allowing the Senator to act, you would sign it, we take it, is that right?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 187: If it complies with the suggestion of the Attorney General.
Sentence 188: Q.
Sentence 189: It would have to be different from the one already passed?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 190: If it complies with this memorandum of the Attorney General, I will sign it.
Sentence 191: Q. Did the Attorney General prepare the original veto, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 192: It was sent to the Attorney General's office for consideration and approval.
Sentence 193: It came from that office approved.

Sentence 195: Q. Mr. President, are you in favor of Government support for any farm products above the 90 percent parity formula?

Sentence 198: Q. Mr. President, I don't think that is true as to wool, I think.

Sentence 201: Q.
Sentence 202: Yes.
Sentence 203: I understand that.
Sentence 204: But--

Sentence 208: Q. Mr. President, one other thing, everybody has gotten out you are going to veto this tax cutting bill when it reaches you.
Sentence 209: You don't discuss legislation--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 210: The best way to find that out is to wait and see.
Sentence 211: Q.
Sentence 212: You think it would be a wrong interpretation from your speeches.
Sentence 213: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 214: You can make any an interpretation from my speeches you want, but so far as legislation is concerned I don't comment on it until it's here!
