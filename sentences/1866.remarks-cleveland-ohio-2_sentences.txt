Sentence 1: 1866 Remarks Cleveland Ohio 2

THE PRESIDENT:
Sentence 2: I know it has been said that I am an alien, [
Laughter.

Sentence 3: and that I did not reside in one of the States of the Union, and therefore could not be the Chief Magistrate, though the constitution declares that I must be a citizen to occupy that office.
Sentence 4: Therefore all that was necessary was to declare the office vacant, or under a pretext to prefer articles of impeachment, and thus the individual who occupies the Chief Magistracy was to be disposed of and driven from power.

Sentence 6: I was placed upon that ticket with a distinguished fellow-citizen, who is now no more.
