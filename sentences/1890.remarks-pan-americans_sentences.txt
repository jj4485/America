Sentence 2: I participate in the regret which the delegates from the United States feel who are to part with those from other countries.
Sentence 3: I take pleasure in the knowledge of the fact that your labors have been brought to a happy conclusion.
Sentence 4: The differences of opinion have been happily reconciled.
Sentence 5: I remark with pleasure the proposition which will be productive of peace among the American States represented in the conference.
Sentence 6: It will be without excuse if one of them shall lift a hostile hand against the other.
Sentence 7: We gave you the other day a review of the small detachment of the American army-not to show you that we have an army, but that we have none; that our securities are lodged with our people and that they are safe.
Sentence 8: We rejoice that you have found in the organization of our country something which commends itself to your own.
Sentence 9: We shall be glad to receive new lessons in return.
Sentence 10: In conclusion, I find much to approve in the friendly purposes of the Conference toward this Government, and I bid each and every one of you a heartfelt good-bye.
