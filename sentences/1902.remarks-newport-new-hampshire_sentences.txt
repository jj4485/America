Sentence 7: We are going to get good government, square and fair dealing between man and man in the nation at large, by the application of exactly the same principles which you find it necessary to apply in order to get good government and decent living here.
Sentence 8: There is no royal road to good government any more than there is a royal road to learning.
Sentence 9: You can give a child every advantage, give him books and the teachers, but he has got to learn, he has got to do that himself, and it is the same way with citizenship.
