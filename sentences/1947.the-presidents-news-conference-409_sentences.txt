Sentence 1: 1947 The Presidents News Conference 409

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have a couple of announcements to make this morning, and a statement to read to you.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: Dwight Griswold, former Governor of Nebraska, and Director of Internal Affairs for General Clay, will be Chief of the United States Mission to Greece.
Sentence 5: And Richard F. Allen will be Field Administrator for Relief for the $350 million.
Sentence 6: In 1940 Mr. Alien became Delegate for Europe of the American Red Cross, and directed the relief program in Europe.
Sentence 7: He directed important relief programs in France before and after the Germans invaded France, and worked closely with Admiral Leahy, then Ambassador to France.
Sentence 8: We will furnish you all that detailed information after this conference is over.
Sentence 9: Q. Will Governor Griswold be in charge, overall, of Greece and Turkey ?
Sentence 10: THE PRESIDENT, Just Greece.
Sentence 11: Q.
Sentence 12: Just Greece?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 13: We haven't decided on the Turkish situation as yet.
Sentence 14: [2.]
Sentence 15: Now I have got a statement here that I want to read to you.
Sentence 16: It is mimeographed, and you will get copies of it.
Sentence 17: It is rather long.
Sentence 18: [Reading] "Senator Taft is reported to have said that 'apparently the President and the administration are abandoning talk of keeping prices down in favor of heavy spending abroad that will keep them up.'
Sentence 19: The Senator said that loans to other countries for the purchase of goods here increase the competition on home markets and thus force prices up.
Sentence 20: "The administration did not advocate the Greek-Turkish aid program for the purpose of bringing prices down.
Sentence 21: It advocated that program for two important reasons--first, to extend aid to starving millions and to help restore their economies so that the world may regain its prosperity in the long run; and second, to help those nations which want to preserve their freedoms and to set up a bulwark against totalitarian aggression.
Sentence 22: The administration fully recognized that these foreign aid programs would place some strain upon the American economy, particularly in the current inflationary situation caused by the high domestic demand and the shortages of some goods.
Sentence 23: But the fact that necessary foreign aid programs add to our economic problems at home makes it all the more important that we handle these domestic problems with vigor and commonsense.
Sentence 24: "Price reductions, wherever they are possible, are made even more urgent because of the additional strain which the world situation inescapably places upon our economy.
Sentence 25: To say that we should abandon our efforts directed toward enduring world peace and freedom because these efforts create economic problems is like saying that we should have abandoned our war effort because it created economic problems.
Sentence 26: "During the war, the tremendous demand for goods would have forced prices to unfortunately high levels except for price control.
Sentence 27: With price control, we held prices at reasonable levels.
Sentence 28: Yet, because of the tremendous volume, business made fine profits even after taxes.
Sentence 29: We now have a tremendous peacetime demand, domestic and foreign, but we have no price control.
Sentence 30: In such a situation, it is up to those whose profits are high at the current inflated prices to reduce these prices voluntarily--in their own interest as well as the interest of the American economy and the world situation.
Sentence 31: The very heart of my request for voluntary price reductions is that business intelligence must now take the place of Government regulation if our economy is to operate in the interest of all the people.
Sentence 32: "The economic implications of Senator Taft's arguments should be fully recognized.
Sentence 33: The Senator states that the only way to bring prices down is to reduce the demand for goods.
Sentence 34: If this were true of foreign demand, it would also be true of domestic demand.
Sentence 35: Let us see where this would lead us.
Sentence 36: If the Government were to abandon its vitally necessary loan and expenditure programs, if wages were reduced, if savings were exhausted, and if unemployment set in, then there would be less demand and prices would drop.
Sentence 37: Senator Taft would call this an adjustment.
Sentence 38: I would call it a tragic recession or a depression.
Sentence 39: There is nothing novel and nothing worthy about getting a price collapse through reducing demand.
Sentence 40: That is the typical road to depression.
Sentence 41: "The problem facing the American people is to maintain full employment, full production, and high demand, and still keep prices at reasonable levels.
Sentence 42: This is the problem to which I have constantly addressed my efforts.
Sentence 43: Senator Taft's argument that high demand justifies or necessitates high prices is fallacious and dangerous.
Sentence 44: It is based upon the idea that prices should seek as high a level as the traffic will bear, rather than the lowest level that is consistent with fair profits.
Sentence 45: That kind of practice is indefensible, and in the long run it would destroy both prosperity and profits.
Sentence 46: The higher and more stable the demand, the more opportunities there are to sell goods--and with assured high volume operations there is less and less justification for wide margins of profit per unit.
Sentence 47: "Senator Taft's economic philosophy follows the old idea of boom and bust.
Sentence 48: Under this economic philosophy, when demand is high, those who have it within their power to administer prices charge every penny that they can get.
Sentence 49: After a while, purchasing power is unable to keep up with the excessive price level.
Sentence 50: Then unemployment, business failures, cuts in production, and price reductions all follow in rapid succession.
Sentence 51: "For my part, I utterly reject this defeatist economic philosophy, and I believe in maintaining a full employment and full production economy.
Sentence 52: This necessarily means a high demand economy.
Sentence 53: But a high demand economy should not be a high price economy.
Sentence 54: On the contrary, high demand makes it feasible to earn good profits at reasonable prices.
Sentence 55: The boom and bust approach could endanger our prosperity even at a time when underlying economic conditions are favorable.
Sentence 56: "My interest in voluntary price reductions is undiminished.
Sentence 57: They are as important now as ever before--if not more important.
Sentence 58: "The drive for voluntary price reductions, while it has not gone far enough, has already yielded substantial results.
Sentence 59: First, the peaceful wage adjustments in some of the major industries took place without corresponding price advances, and this helped to bring production and purchasing power into better balance.
Sentence 60: Second, in recent months, the trend toward extraordinary price increases which commenced with decontrol has been checked and moderate price declines have taken place.
Sentence 61: This is illustrated in the following table.
Sentence 62: "
I won't read the whole table, but it shows that all commodities have decreased 2 points.
Sentence 63: Farm products have increased 5.8.
Sentence 64: Foods have increased 9.1.
Sentence 65: All others have decreased 0.1 of a point.
Sentence 66: You can analyze that table when you get your mimeographed sheet.
Sentence 67: "Price reduction in many items of farm products and foods is as important as in the case of industrial products.
Sentence 68: As the table shows, these prices have been reduced recently.
Sentence 69: Further reductions may be anticipated.
Sentence 70: Neither the individual farmer, however, nor the trader, nor the Government can--in the absence of price control-determine agricultural prices.
Sentence 71: They depend largely on competitive market conditions.
Sentence 72: "On the other hand, in the case of many industrial products deliberate voluntary price reduction is feasible, and in some cases, such as construction and construction materials, high prices impede activity of the highest economic and social importance.
Sentence 73: Yet, as the table shows, industrial prices have not come down as much as prices of farm products and food.
Sentence 74: They have been more resistant to desirable decreases.
Sentence 75: It is true that intensive foreign demand has kept some farm prices higher than they otherwise would be.
Sentence 76: But this is no reason for keeping industrial prices high where they could now be reduced for the long-run advantage of business and the country.
Sentence 77: "
You will get a copy of that when you go out.
Sentence 78: Now I am ready for questions.
Sentence 79: [3.]
Sentence 80: Q. Mr. President, across the country I have found that they blame not so much the purchasing of wheat for relief abroad but the method used by the Agriculture Department in failing to consult the users of grain in this country before they went into market.
Sentence 81: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 82: I don't think that is true at all because those purchases remain after consultation with the very people you are talking about.
Sentence 83: Q.
Sentence 84: They just claim not.
Sentence 85: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 86: Of course they want something to hide behind.
Sentence 87: [4.]
Sentence 88: Q. Can you give us an advance on what the President is going to do on the tax and labor bills ?
Sentence 89: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 90: No, I cannot.
Sentence 91: I will give you that when I get those bills and analyze them.
Sentence 92: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us when you expect to act on the tax bill?
Sentence 93: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 94: As soon as I get it officially.
Sentence 95: Q.
Sentence 96: You haven't received the bill officially?
Sentence 97: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 98: It came up officially yesterday afternoon, and I haven't seen it.
Sentence 99: As soon as I can, I will give you an announcement on it.
Sentence 100: [5.]
Sentence 101: Q. Mr. President, so many people have criticized in this field, I wonder why you picked Senator Taft?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 102: Senator Taft made a statement that wouldn't hold water the other day, and he had to be answered.
Sentence 103: He represents that sort of economy, and I think that's a thing I should comment on.
Sentence 104: [6.]
Sentence 105: Q. What is your comment on the Kansas City vote fraud investigation?
Sentence 106: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 107: The Kansas City vote fraud investigation should be carried through to its logical conclusion.
Sentence 108: No one wants to condone vote frauds.
Sentence 109: It is the worst thing that can happen in a democracy.
Sentence 110: Q. Mr. President, does that mean a grand jury investigation of the primaries?
Sentence 111: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 112: I can't answer that, sir.
Sentence 113: The grand jury investigation of the primary has been made by State courts.
Sentence 114: Q. Federal grand juries?
Sentence 115: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 116: I don't know anything about that.
Sentence 117: I don't know what the laws are in regard to Federal powers in a primary investigation.
Sentence 118: You will have to look it up.
Sentence 119: Q. Have you discussed the matter with Attorney General Clark?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: No, I have not.
Sentence 121: [7.]
Sentence 122: Q. Mr. President, a few weeks ago you said that Messersmith was on a temporary mission in Argentina.
Sentence 123: Has he finished that mission now, sir?
Sentence 124: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 125: Yes, he has.
Sentence 126: Q. Does that mean he is coming back right away?
Sentence 127: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 128: I judge so.
Sentence 129: Q. Have you selected a successor for him?
Sentence 130: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: No I have not.
Sentence 132: He hasn't come back yet.
Sentence 133: Q. Will he remain in the diplomatic service, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 134: Well now, he will have to answer that question.
Sentence 135: [8.]
Sentence 136: Q. Mr. President, do you want to say anything at all about this Hungarian situation?
Sentence 137: 1
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 138: I think it's an outrage.
Sentence 139: The Hungarian situation is a terrible one.
Sentence 140: And we are having it looked into right now.
Sentence 141: 1
On May 30 in a coup d'etat Hungarian Communists had installed a pro-Communist government, forcing the resignation of Premier Nagy.
Sentence 142: Q.
Sentence 143: May I go a little further on that?
Sentence 144: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: Sure.
Sentence 146: Q.
Sentence 147: I think the Star--Evening Star tells you what to do.
Sentence 148: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 149: Do they ?
Sentence 150: Nobody in the country can--
Q. Shake a fist, not a finger, something of that sort, which leads up to the question which I think you answered--you said it's an outrage and you don't intend to stand by
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 151: Idly by.
Sentence 152: And that we are looking into the matter.
Sentence 153: The State Department is making a complete investigation.
Sentence 154: Q. Will the State Department withdraw the loan to Hungary for the purchase of American cotton?
Sentence 155: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 156: You will have to ask the State Department on that.
Sentence 157: I don't know what they have done--only what I see in the paper.
Sentence 158: [9.]
Sentence 159: Q. Mr. President, going back to Argentina, I believe you answered the question, but I didn't hear.
Sentence 160: Can you say when Mr. Messersmith is coming back?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 161: NO, I can't.
Sentence 162: [10.]
Sentence 163: Q. I want to ask you about Henry Savage
1
who is running for Congress in the Third District.--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 164: He is the nominee of the Democratic Party, and he will be supported by the National Democratic Committee.
Sentence 165: Is that what you want?
Sentence 166: 1
The reporter may have been referring to Charles R. Savage, Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative for the 3d District of the State of Washington.
Sentence 167: In a special election held on June 7, 1947, Mr. Savage was defeated by Russell V. Mack, a Republican.
Sentence 168: Q. Yes sir.
Sentence 169: [Laughter]
Sentence 170: [11.]

Sentence 173: [12.]
Sentence 174: Q. On--with regard to Ambassador Messersmith, have you accepted his resignation?
Sentence 175: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 176: No.
Sentence 177: I haven't received any resignation from him as yet.
Sentence 178: Q. I would like to get this clear.
Sentence 179: Have you recalled him?
Sentence 180: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 181: I have taken no action on it at all.
Sentence 182: That is up to the State Department.
Sentence 183: They will handle the matter.
Sentence 184: His mission is completed, and he went down there with the understanding that when his mission was completed he would want to come home.
Sentence 185: Q.
Sentence 186: Do you regard his mission as successful, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 187: Yes, I do.
Sentence 188: [13.]
Sentence 189: Q. Mr. President, the Democratic pamphlet "Capital Comment" says, "Watch for further Democratic action soon on housing."

Sentence 192: [14.]
Sentence 193: Q. Mr. President, can you say specifically what the Messersmith mission wasp
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 195: We are on friendly terms with Argentina.
Sentence 196: That is what he went there for.
Sentence 197: [15.]
Sentence 198: Q. Mr. President, was Senator Taft correct in saying that foreign loans and advances exert an inflationary influence on the domestic price level?
Sentence 199: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 201: I have answered that in the statement which I just made.
Sentence 202: Reporter:
Sentence 203: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 204: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 205: You're welcome.
