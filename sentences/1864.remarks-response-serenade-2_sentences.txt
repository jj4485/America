Sentence 1: 1864 Remarks Response Serenade 2

It has long been a grave question whether any government, not too strong for the liberties of its people, can be strong enough to maintain its own existence, in great emergencies.
Sentence 2: On this point the present rebellion brought our republic to a severe test; and a presidential election occurring in regular course during the rebellion added not a little to the strain.
Sentence 3: If the loyal people, united, were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided, and partially paralized, by a political war among themselves?
Sentence 4: But the election was a necessity.
Sentence 5: We can not have free government without elections; and if the rebellion could force us to forego, or postpone a national election, it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us.
Sentence 6: The strife of the election is but human-nature practically applied to the facts of the case.
Sentence 7: What has occurred in this case, must ever recur in similar cases.
Sentence 8: Human-nature will not change.
Sentence 9: In any future great national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall have as weak, and as strong; as silly and as wise; as bad and good.
Sentence 10: Let us, therefore, study the incidents of this, as philosophy to learn wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged.
Sentence 11: But the election, along with its incidental, and undesirable strife, has done good too.
Sentence 12: It has demonstrated that a people's government can sustain a national election, in the midst of a great civil war.
Sentence 13: Until now it has not been known to the world that this was a possibility.
Sentence 14: It shows also how sound, and how strong we still are.
Sentence 15: It shows that, even among candidates of the same party, he who is most devoted to the Union, and most opposed to treason, can receive most of the people's votes.
Sentence 16: It shows also, to the extent yet known, that we have more men now, than we had when the war began.
Sentence 17: Gold is good in its place; but living, brave, patriotic men, are better than gold.
Sentence 18: But the rebellion continues; and now that the election is over, may not all, having a common interest, re-unite in a common effort, to save our common country?
Sentence 19: For my own part I have striven, and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way.
Sentence 20: So long as I have been here I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom.
Sentence 21: While I am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a re-election; and duly grateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion, as I think, for their own good, it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or pained by the result.
Sentence 22: May I ask those who have not differed with me, to join with me, in this same spirit towards those who have?
Sentence 23: And now, let me close by asking three hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen and their gallant and skilful commanders.
