Sentence 5: [1.]
Sentence 6: Q. Mr. President, I think the trainmen and the conductors sent telegrams to you today, saying that they were starting strikes Tuesday on two specific railroads-not terminals, as they had called it before.
Sentence 7: I wondered if you had anything in mind on coping with those strikes?
Sentence 8: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 9: I haven't received the telegrams.
Sentence 10: The railroad brotherhoods and the railroad management are negotiating--trying to reach an agreement here in Washington, but that is all I know about it.

Sentence 19: They are negotiating every day.
Sentence 20: [2.]
Sentence 21: Q. Mr. President, there is some confusion about your views with respect to universal training.
Sentence 22: I wonder if you would straighten us out on it?
Sentence 23: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 24: Well, Mr. Ross covered that thoroughly this morning.
Sentence 25: 1
I noticed the ticker just before I came over here, and what he said is exactly correct and covers the situation completely.
Sentence 26: 1 Charles G. Ross, Secretary to the President, had announced that while the administration reaffirmed its support of a universal military training bill the President would not press for its immediate enactment.
Sentence 27: See also Item 225.

Sentence 29: Q. Mr. President, you have always been a backer of home rule for the District.
Sentence 30: The bill to get the home rule bill on the floor of the House lacks 15 or 20 signatures.
Sentence 31: Would you care to comment on how that might be pushed over?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 32: Well, I would like very much, of course, to see the District get its home rule program.
Sentence 33: It will be a fine thing if they could get that bill out as promptly as they did that post office bill the other day-of which I am not in favor.
Sentence 34: Q. Mr. President, does that mean that you will probably veto the post office bill?
Sentence 35: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 36: Oh, we can't talk about that until it gets here.
Sentence 37: You see, it hasn't passed the Senate yet, and there are still a lot of maneuvers before I have to act on it.
Sentence 38: I will make that decision when it comes before me, as always.
Sentence 39: [4.]
Sentence 40: Q. Mr. President, going back to UMT, a Hill source said that your position was that you would not use UMT until after the Korean war, even if it were voted.
Sentence 41: Is that correct, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 42: Well, the situation with respect to UMT has been very capably covered by Charlie, and I don't want to get into that controversial matter.
Sentence 43: I am trying to get emergency legislation that is necessary in our present emergency passed, and this is a very controversial subject.
Sentence 44: My position on it has been made amply clear.
Sentence 45: You will find at least five messages to the Congress, and several letters to the chairmen of these committees, which explain exactly how I stand on the matter.
Sentence 46: I am for universal training, and always have been, but I don't see any reason now for cluttering up the Congress with another controversial matter when they seem to have controversy enough on what they have.
Sentence 47: [5.]
Sentence 48: Q. Mr. President, in view of the announcement about Mayor O'Dwyer,
2
do you wish to make any general comment about United States relations with Mexico, or what you might hope a new Ambassador would do there?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 49: Well, for several months Mayor O'Dwyer has been considering the Ambassadorship to Mexico.
