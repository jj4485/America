Sentence 4: On Saturday morning at 10:30, in the White House movie theater, we will discuss the Budget Message with those who are interested, as is usually done each year.
Sentence 5: Now I am ready for questions.
Sentence 6: Q. Mr. President, why is the--why has there been a delay in the State of the Union
Message?
Sentence 7: Is it hooked up with the labor situation?
Sentence 8: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 9: No.
Sentence 10: It was a decision shortly arrived at, that one message is enough.
Sentence 11: The State of the Union Message and the Budget Message will go down together.

Sentence 20: [Laughter]
Sentence 21: [3.]
Sentence 22: Q. Mr. President, what did you and Mr. Farley talk about this morning, and did it include New York State politics?

Sentence 25: Q. Could you tell us what else?
Sentence 26: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 27: Everything else under the sun.
Sentence 28: Oh, personal matters, principally.
Sentence 29: [4.]
Sentence 30: Q. Mr. President, the delegation in London seems to be divided on the question of whether or not the Japanese mandated islands that we conquered out in the Pacific should be placed under a U.N.O. trusteeship.
Sentence 31: What is the administration's policy on that?
Sentence 32: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: Those that we do not need will be placed under a U.N.O. trusteeship.
Sentence 34: Q.
Sentence 35: And those that we need--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 36: We will keep.
Sentence 37: Q.--we will annex, sir?
Sentence 38: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 39: We will keep.
Sentence 40: Q.
Sentence 41: Forever?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 42: That depends.
Sentence 43: As long as we need them.
Sentence 44: Q. Will we go through a form of individual trusteeship for--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 45: Yes.
Sentence 46: Yes, it will be under an individual trusteeship.
Sentence 47: Q.
Sentence 48: For the islands we need?
Sentence 49: The others will be collective?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 51: Q. Wouldn't that be under the Security Council?
Sentence 52: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: I beg your pardon?

Sentence 57: Just like all the rest of them.
Sentence 58: Q.
Sentence 59: Well then, Mr. President, the way that will work out will be that there will be some islands under our trusteeship and some under the individual trusteeship of other nations?
Sentence 60: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 61: Well, no.
Sentence 62: It will be through collective trusteeships, in most instances.
Sentence 63: Q.
Sentence 64: You envision that we will be the only nation that will have individual control--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 65: That is not necessarily the case.
Sentence 66: We will have to work those things out as we come to them, and inaugurate the policy as we go along.
Sentence 67: Q.
Sentence 68: On those islands where we are the sole trustees, will we know the United Nations are all for that?
Sentence 69: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 76: Q. Mr. President, some of the supporters of the Hobbs antilabor-racketeering bill on the Hill complain that it is stymied in congressional committees.
Sentence 77: The question is whether in view of your radio speech you have any comment to make on that?

Sentence 79: [6.]
Sentence 80: Q. Mr. President, in accepting the General Motors fact finding board's increase, the union put a limit of a week on its acceptance.

Sentence 86: Do you have any comment on this-on this contract that was signed by KaiserFrazer, where they added a bonus?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 90: [7.]
Sentence 91: Q. Mr. President, at the end of the Fairless-Murray meeting the other day, Mr. Ross told us that--in giving us a sort of narrative--that Mr. Fairless made a proposal and Mr. Murray made a counterproposal.
Sentence 92: Was that Fairless proposal a new proposal, or a reiteration of one of his old ones?
Sentence 93: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 94: I can't answer that.
Sentence 95: All I know is that be made the proposal and then Murray made the counterproposal.
Sentence 96: It all took place before he came here.

Sentence 109: What leading architects?[Laughter]
1
A White House release, dated January 11, outlined plans for the work, noting that the $1,650,000 construction project would be divided into four main units: (1) addition to the Executive Offices; (2) completion of the East Wing; (3) interior alterations to the Mansion; and (4) landscaping and improvements to the grounds.
Sentence 110: Q.
Sentence 111: The American Institute of Architects.
Sentence 112: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 113: I have never been in touch with the American Institute of Architects.
Sentence 114: And the Park and Planning Commission have approved the program, and all the architects we have talked to are in favor of the program.
Sentence 115: And it is built principally for your benefit.
Sentence 116: I am going to have an auditorium in which you gentlemen can sit down and ask me questions.
Sentence 117: [Laughter]
Q.
Sentence 118: These architects, Mr. President, feel that the White House should be the President's home.
Sentence 119: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: Well, I feel that way, too.
Sentence 121: But this has no connection whatever with the White House.
Sentence 122: This is an addition to the offices of the President.
Sentence 123: Q.
Sentence 124: That is what they are opposed to.
Sentence 125: They think--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 126: They don't want the President to have any offices to work in.
Sentence 127: It's just something to talk about.
Sentence 128: [9.]
Sentence 129: Q. Mr. President, getting back to the Pacific Islands, there are several islands below the Equator which I understand are not Japanese mandated.
Sentence 130: Are you interested in those?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: Only in conjunction with our allies.
Q. Mr. President, have we decided which of the mandated islands we need?
Sentence 132: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 133: We have not.
Sentence 134: Q.
Sentence 135: We have not?
Sentence 136: [10.]
Sentence 137: Q. Are you still hopeful that the steel strike will be settled--on the steel--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 138: Yes, I am.
Sentence 139: [11.]
Sentence 140: Q. Mr. President, I am curious to know why you are combining the messages?
Sentence 141: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 142: Because I think it is necessary that they should be combined.
Sentence 143: The State of the Union is wrapped up in the Budget.
Sentence 144: Q.
Sentence 145: But you meant to send two?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 146: Well, I didn't necessarily mean to send two.
Sentence 147: After giving the matter a great deal of study, I came to the conclusion that one message would be just as good as two, and in fact a little better, I think.
Sentence 148: Q. Mr. President, how long is that going to be, when you put them together?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 149: Well, it will be long enough to keep you busy for quite some time.
Sentence 150: [Laughter]
Sentence 151: [12.]
Sentence 152: Q.
Sentence 153: The Mayor of Chicago just told us that he discussed with you the--a way to prevent all of these firearms coming into the country as souvenirs and being used in a bad way in this country; and he said that Mr. Hannegan might do something to stop that.
Sentence 154: Can you tell us about that?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 155: He did discuss it with me.
Sentence 156: We have been looking into that situation for quite some time and are trying to take the necessary steps to prevent those implements of destruction from getting into the wrong hands.
Sentence 157: [13.]
Sentence 158: Q. Mr. President, have you come to any decision on raising the price of steel?
Sentence 159: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 160: No, I have not.
Sentence 161: That hasn't been discussed with me.
Sentence 162: [14.]
Sentence 163: Q. Mr. President, a moment ago, when someone asked you about possible comment on labor's stand in this General Motors strike, you said you had nothing more to say than that you had approved the fact finding.
Sentence 164: Does that preclude any comment on management's stand?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 165: Management didn't take much interest in that fact-finding report, and I hope that they will at a later date.
Sentence 166: [15.]
Sentence 167: Q. Mr. President, have you any sort of comment on demobilization?
Sentence 168: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 169: I think General Eisenhower covered that very thoroughly this morning before the Congress, as did the Navy.
Sentence 170: I have a copy of the statement here, which I haven't had a chance to read yet.
Sentence 171: [16.]
Sentence 172: Q. Mr. President, how do you feel about the general progress of the United Nations meeting in London?
Sentence 173: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 174: I think it is doing remarkably well.
Sentence 175: And I think it is going to accomplish the purpose for which it was intended; that is, keep the future peace.
Sentence 176: Q. Mr. President--
Q. Mr. President, are there any plans--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 177: Let me answer the lady's question, and then I will answer yours.
Sentence 178: [17.]
Sentence 179: Q. Did the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry leave any preliminary recommendations or report with you this morning?
Sentence 180: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 181: NO.
Sentence 182: They did not have facts enough to base any preliminary report on.
Sentence 183: [18.]
Sentence 184: Q. Mr. President, are there any plans for taking over the meat packing industry?
Sentence 185: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 186: There are not.
Sentence 187: [19.]
Sentence 188: Q. Mr. President, do you expect to discuss the St. Lawrence Seaway in your State of the Union Message?
Sentence 189: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 190: I don't think so.
Sentence 191: I sent a special message on that, and that special message still stands.
Sentence 192: [20.]
Sentence 193: Q. Mr. President, General Eisenhower said this morning that the requirements of the Army for a million and a half men by July 1st couldn't be met unless the recruiting program, or the enlistments under Selective Service were increased, that they were now well below the 50,000 a month that they needed.
Sentence 194: Are there any plans to increase the Selective Service call now, to hitch it up to that?
Sentence 195: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 196: We have been asking the Selective Service for So, odd a month.
Sentence 197: I think the greatest number they have ever got was 37,000.
Sentence 198: Q. Is there anything that can be done to bring that up?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 199: I don't know of anything.
Sentence 200: Selective Service has that.
Sentence 201: [21.]
Sentence 202: Q. Mr. President, has anybody intervened with you in behalf of this boy who is accused of killing two Japanese?
Sentence 203: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 204: No.
Q. Have you anything on it?
Sentence 205: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 206: I have had no official word on it.
Sentence 207: All I know about it is what I have seen, the Post article in the paper.
Sentence 208: [22.]
Sentence 209: Q. Mr. President, when are you sending up the special message on the British loan?
Sentence 210: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 211: After the annual message goes up, yes.
Sentence 212: [23.]
Sentence 213: Q. Mr. President, do you have any plans for asking any additional authority over labor disputes, in addition to your fact-finding?
Sentence 214: The reason I ask that is this: under your fact-finding procedure as proposed--such as has been gone through with this subpoenaing of the books at this time-you have a strike more than 30 days old so that the situation will be just as it is now.
Sentence 215: I am wondering whether you have any other plans?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 216: No.
Sentence 217: I think a fact finding setup would answer the purpose.
Sentence 218: It has worked very satisfactorily in the railroad program, and that was where I got the idea.
Sentence 219: I have been on the Interstate Commerce Committee of the Senate, and studied that situation very thoroughly, and have appointed, since I have been President, several fact-finding committees for railroad disputes.
Sentence 220: They worked very successfully.
Sentence 221: Q.
Sentence 222: The reason I asked that, sir, was this: if this bill had been passed before this General Motors fact-finding board had been named--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 223: I think the General Motors strike would have been settled, if that had been done.
Sentence 224: [24.]
Sentence 225: Q. Mr. President, could you tell us anything about Mr. Lockers report?
Sentence 226: You remember in Kansas City you said it would be out in a few days.
Sentence 227: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 228: We decided to hold it up for a future release until General Marshall's job is completed in China.
Sentence 229: Q.
Sentence 230: You haven't got any idea at this time, then, when that might be?
Sentence 231: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 232: No.
Sentence 233: It will be released at a very much later date.
Sentence 234: Reporter:
Sentence 235: Thank you, Mr. President.
