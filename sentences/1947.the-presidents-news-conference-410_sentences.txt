Sentence 1: 1947 The Presidents News Conference 410

THE PRESIDENT..
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: Ladies and gentlemen of the press conference, I thought it would be more convenient for us to have a conference on the day before New Year's, rather than at 8 o'clock on New Year's morning, or the day after New Year's--[laughter]-so we set it.
Sentence 4: Since we missed last week, we thought you would want one for this week.
Sentence 5: I want to wish all of you a happy and prosperous 1948, and to say to you that I think 1947 has been a good year--not as good as we would like to have it, none of them ever are--and that I am still confidently looking forward to a world peace on which all the nations can agree, and the proper implementation of the United Nations.
Sentence 6: I always think of the Constitution of the United States and the difficulties that took place in the Colonies between 1781 and 1789, and then the difficulties that took place between 1789 and 1809.
Sentence 7: If you carefully look over that situation, you will find that they had tremendous difficulties in those days, almost exactly the same situation with which we are faced now, both in Europe and here, and that it took just about 80 years, really, to get the Constitution properly implemented.
Sentence 8: In fact, it was not the Constitution of the United States until 1865.
Sentence 9: So I don't think we ought to be discouraged at things that sometimes get in our way in making this tremendous peace organization work.
Sentence 10: I did not intend to make you a speech, but I am very much interested in that situation, and I have every faith in the final working of the United Nations as a means of general world peace, for the simple reason that we can't afford anything else.
Sentence 11: It is to our selfish interests and to the selfish interests of every country in the world that we do have a workable world peace.
Sentence 12: Q. Mr. President, that is a very good speech.
Sentence 13: Could we have the text of that for direct quotes ?
Sentence 14: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 15: Yes.
Sentence 16: Q.
Sentence 17: It's quite well worth it.
Sentence 18: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 19: I didn't intend to make you a speech, but I am highly interested in that, and that's all I have been working for since September 1945.
Sentence 20: Now if you have any questions that I can answer, I will be glad to hear from you.
Sentence 21: [2.]
Sentence 22: Q. I would like to ask you a question about the General Electric Company's cut.
Sentence 23: Have you any comment on their promise of reduction in prices to help reverse the spiral ?
Sentence 24: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: I will read you a telegram I have here to Mr. Wilson,
1
who happens to be a personal friend of mine.
Sentence 26: 1
Charles E. Wilson, president of the General Electric Co.
[Reading] "The Company's announcement of a price reduction for consumer goods is extremely heartening in the Nation's fight against inflation.
Sentence 27: Should other industries follow your example, a real bulwark will be built against rising prices.
Sentence 28: "
Mr. Wilson, as you know, was here all during the war, with the War Production Board, and he was chairman of the committee which wrote the report on the bill of rights.
Sentence 29: Q. Mr. President, did he get in touch with you personally before he made the cut?
Sentence 30: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 31: No, he didn't talk to me at all.

Sentence 44: Two?
Sentence 45: Q.
Sentence 46: Yes.
Sentence 47: Mr. Landis and Young.

Sentence 50: Well, I am going to fill those just as quickly as I can.
Sentence 51: Q. Mr. President, would you give us the reason why you are not going to reappoint Mr. Landis ?
Sentence 52: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: I have no comment to make on that.
Sentence 54: Q. Mr. President, one other question related to that.
Sentence 55: I believe it is the rule that the President appoints only for action January 31st
Sentence 56: the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Board.
Sentence 57: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: Well, there is a Vice Chairman who will act as Chairman now until the Chairman is appointed, which will be done just as quickly as I can get around to it.

Sentence 74: I am considering Jim Mead for several positions, but not particularly for these two.
Sentence 75: [7.]
Sentence 76: Q. Mr. President, have you set a date for the transmittal of the message to Congress ?
Sentence 77: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 78: The Message on the State of the Union will go down on January 7th, the Economic Message on the 9th, and the Budget Message probably the following Monday.
Sentence 79: We have to get all those things ready, and it's a tremendous job.

Sentence 102: Q. Mr. President, in connection with the commodities market, in October when you criticized gambling in grain futures, I wonder if you could tell us what line you drew between what is called greedy speculation and legitimate trading?
Sentence 103: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: It's easy enough for you to draw that line, Smitty,
1
but I think I had better write you an essay on it.
Sentence 105: It's a very complicated subject; and I will do that some day.
Sentence 106: [Laughter]

The statement, released by the Department of State on December 30, follows:
"The claim of certain Communist guerrilla leaders that they have established at some unknown point a 'First Provisional Democratic Government of Free Greece' is a transparent device, the true purpose of which will be clear to everyone.
Sentence 144: It is only a phase in the familiar effort of certain elements to overthrow the legitimate and recognized Greek Government and to threaten the territorial integrity and political independence of Greece.
Sentence 145: It came as no surprise In itself, it would not materially change the existing situation.
Sentence 146: "But if other countries were to recognize the group, this step would have serious implications.
Sentence 147: It would be clearly contrary to the principles of the United Nations Charter.
Sentence 148: And if the country concerned were one of Greece's neighbors to the north, the act would constitute an open disregard of the recent recommendations of the United Nations Assembly, as set forth in the resolution of last October.
