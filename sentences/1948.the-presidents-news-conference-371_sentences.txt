Q. There was one report that you might make 500 appearances between Labor Day and Election Day?
Sentence 173: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 176: [10.]
Sentence 177: Q. Mr. President, will recognition of the Government of Israel have to wait until after the election in Israel?

Sentence 180: I cannot give you a definite answer on it now.
Sentence 181: [11.]
Sentence 182: Q. Mr. President, I think there may be some confusion about Mr. Marshall's statement yesterday regarding the Italian colonies.
Sentence 183: He said that the policy was bipartisan.
Sentence 184: Does that mean that Mr. Dewey has been consulted--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 185: General Marshall's statement will have to stand on just what he said.
Sentence 186: Reporter:
Sentence 187: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 188: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 189: You are entirely welcome.
