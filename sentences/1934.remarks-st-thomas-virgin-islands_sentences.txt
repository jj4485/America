Sentence 1: 1934 Remarks St Thomas Virgin Islands

I just wanted to say a word while we are here in the family that I am very proud of the work that has been done down in the Virgin Islands because it shows what can be done with a little help from Washington and a great deal of cooperation down here toward improving the conditions of a great many thousands of human beings.
Sentence 2: Of course, we never expect the Virgin Islands to be a tremendous factor in trade but we do hope that they may be self-sustaining.
Sentence 3: The experiment that we are working out in the Virgin Islands is being watched by Washington with a great deal of interest.
Sentence 4: We have a unit in the Virgin Islands where we can actually see the results of their work.
Sentence 5: I am very proud of what you have done.
Sentence 6: I hope to come here again before I leave Washington and see some more of these fine results.
Sentence 7: I am glad to see you all.
