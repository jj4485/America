Sentence 1: 1950 The Presidents News Conference 601

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have no special announcements to make this morning.
Sentence 3: I will try to answer questions, if I can.
Sentence 4: [1.]
Sentence 5: Q. Mr. President, I wonder if you would comment on the railroad strike and what might be done to bring it to an end?
Sentence 6: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 7: The railroad strike has been brought about by a very small minority of the switchmen.
Sentence 8: It is an unjustified strike, and the men ought to go back to work at once.
Sentence 9: They had the views of a very able board, made up of the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Utah, the former chief justice of the Supreme Court of Indiana, and the professor of economics of California University.
Sentence 10: The Mediation Board suggested that they go back to work, and they should have gone back to work when the Mediation Board suggested.
Sentence 11: I hope it won't be necessary to take drastic action to force them back to work.
Sentence 12: 1

See Item 188.
Sentence 13: [2.]
Sentence 14: Q. Mr. President, two questions, sir.
Sentence 15: First, have you any comment on Mr. Martin Hutchinson's case now?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 16: Well, Martin Hutchinson's case is pending before the Senate for confirmation, and I am still backing him.
Sentence 17: 2

On March 6, 1950, Martin A. Hutchinson of Virginia was nominated to be a member of the Federal Trade Commission.
Sentence 18: The Senate rejected the nomination on August 9, 1950.
Sentence 19: [3.]
Sentence 20: Q.
Sentence 21: And secondly, sir, would you care to state your intentions regarding Mr. Sumner Pike?
Sentence 22: One Senate leader states he would vote for him if you were to assure the Senate that you will not appoint him Chairman of the AEC.
Sentence 23: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 24: I will make no such assurance.
Sentence 25: I am back of Mr. Pike, and he ought to be confirmed.
Sentence 26: He has been confirmed twice by the Senate, and this is a foolish procedure.
Sentence 27: 3

Sumner T. Pike held the position of Acting Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission from the time that the resignation of David E. Lilienthal became effective on February 15, 1950.
Sentence 28: Mr. Pike's 4-year term as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission had expired on June 30.
Sentence 29: He was subsequently confirmed by the United States Senate for another 4-year term on July 10, 1950.
Sentence 30: Gordon E. Dean was appointed Chairman of the Commission on July 11, 1950.
Sentence 31: Q. Mr. President, one or two of his opponents on the Hill imply that he has dragged his heels on some very important defense projects recently ordered by you?
Sentence 32: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: It is not true, and it has been testified by the Defense Department that Sumner Pike has been always cooperative.
Sentence 34: If I had been intending to appoint Sumner Pike Chairman of the Commission, I would have done it a long time ago.
Sentence 35: But I will make no such assurances to the Senate that I won't appoint him.
Sentence 36: [4.]
Sentence 37: Q. Mr. President, may I ask one more question about the railway strike, please?
Sentence 38: You said you hoped it will not be necessary to take drastic action.
Sentence 39: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 40: That's correct.
Sentence 41: Q. Do you feel that the strike, although limited, is sufficiently important to require action, like going before Congress with a message to the Congress, or seizure ?
Sentence 42: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 43: I didn't understand that question.
Sentence 44: Will you repeat it, please?
Sentence 45: Q. Do you feel, sir, that this strike of the switchmen is important enough, even though it is limited, to require that you go before Congress, or seek seizure through the courts?
Sentence 46: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: Well, this strike is tieing up five mainline railroads, two of which are absolutely essential to the movement of the wheat crop and to the movement of cattle from the grass pastures to the feed lots in the Middle West, and it seems to me that that is reason enough for drastic action unless the strike is discontinued.
Sentence 48: [5.]
Sentence 49: Q. Mr. President, at the hearing on Mr. Pike, no charges were made against him, and no questions were asked him.
Sentence 50: Are you aware of the nature of the opposition to him?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 52: It is purely political.

Sentence 63: [7.]

Sentence 66: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 98: [10.]
Sentence 99: Q. Mr. President, there was a story in one of the morning papers today to the effect that some 40 reserve battalions will be called into action--into mobilization to back up MacArthur?

Sentence 110: Q. Mr. President, yesterday Secretary of Defense Johnson said that the Joint Chiefs and the service Secretaries were not making any public pronouncements or speeches during the month of July because, he said, there was a possibility of misinterpretations with this Korean situation going on.
Sentence 111: He said you were very happy to learn of this, and he said we should ask you whether you plan to do the same thing.
Sentence 112: We asked him and he said to ask you about it.
Sentence 113: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 114: I have no dates in mind right at the present time.
Sentence 115: And I am very happy that the Defense Department is going to devote all their time to their job over there, instead of making speeches.
Sentence 116: [Laughter]
Sentence 117: [12.]
Sentence 118: Q. Mr. President, could you tell us anything about the effect that the war in Korea may have on the military aid program as regards Korea?
Sentence 119: Will the expenditures originally intended to fortify their own military forces be now available for use elsewhere since our own military is in there fighting, under United Nations auspices?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: No, there will not be, and I can make no comment on that until we get the final results of the situation as it develops in Korea.
