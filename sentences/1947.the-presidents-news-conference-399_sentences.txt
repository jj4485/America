Sentence 1: 1947 The Presidents News Conference 399

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I have an important statement to make to you this morning which I think is one of the most important that I have made in a good while.
Sentence 4: You will recall that in my statement of November 9th accompanying the action removing all wage controls and all but a few price controls, I concluded by saying that the responsibility for working out agreements for the adjustment of differences, without interruptions to production, now rested squarely upon labor and management.
Sentence 5: I have a joint letter from the Associated General Contractors of America and the Building and Construction Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor.
Sentence 6: The Associated General Contractors represent management while the Building and Construction Trades Department represents nineteen international unions and approximately two million workers.
Sentence 7: The letter encloses an agreement setting up a plan of industrial peace for the construction industry.
Sentence 8: Let me read you a few excerpts from the letter.
Sentence 9: All these documents are being mimeographed and will be available for you as you go out, in toto.
Sentence 10: "We are enclosing a copy of a plan"-this is the quotation from the letter--
"We are enclosing a copy of a plan to provide a National Joint Conference Committee in the building and construction industry for the settlement of any dispute or disagreement which may arise and which is voluntarily submitted to the Committee by mutual agreement of the parties involved in the dispute.
Sentence 11: "Having established this voluntary machinery to settle disputes in this important industry without stoppage of work by lockout or strike, our organizations intend to exert every effort to see that these procedures are used wherever possible to settle any dispute that may arise--over the terms of new contracts or over the interpretation of existing agreements.
Sentence 12: "This important industry is anxious to accept its responsibility--both labor and management.
Sentence 13: We will make our contribution toward providing the highest possible measure of industrial peace.
Sentence 14: "
Now you will get the full text of those agreements mimeographed.
Sentence 15: In my Message to the Congress on the State of the Union, I said: "We have established a national labor policy in this country based upon free collective bargaining as the process for determining wages and working conditions.
Sentence 16: This is still the national policy; it should continue to be the national policy."
Sentence 17: That is the end of the quotation from the message.
Sentence 18: The agreement signed by the Associated General Contractors of America and the Building and Construction Trades Department of the A.F. of L. is a significant step forward in industrial relations in this country.
Sentence 19: We have had good labor news during the past 10 days.
Sentence 20: The Steelworkers and the steel producing subsidiaries of the United States Steel Corporation have reached a final agreement on the problem of eliminating wage rate inequities--a highly complicated problem on which they had been working for over 2 years.
Sentence 21: The same parties have also reached an agreement to postpone the expiration date of their present contract until April 30.
Sentence 22: The United States Rubber Company and the rubber workers union of the CIO have also recently reached agreement on a significant contract.
Sentence 23: The making of these agreements indicates a widespread willingness to resolve industrial disputes without resort to force.
Sentence 24: We are moving closer and closer to our ideals of free collective bargaining.
Sentence 25: Now for questions, if you have any.
Sentence 26: Q.
Sentence 27: Do you think that may extend into other industries as well--beyond the building trades, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 28: I hope it will--I hope it will.
Sentence 29: Q. Mr. President, does that take in the things that you mention, such as jurisdictional strikes--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 30: Yes, it takes in all those things.
Sentence 31: Yes it does.
Sentence 32: Q. Secondary boycotts?
Sentence 33: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 34: That takes in all those things.
Sentence 35: I think that you will find the statement has well set out all those things, when you get the mimeographed copies of the complete agreement.
Sentence 36: Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 37: [The questioner then started to leave.
