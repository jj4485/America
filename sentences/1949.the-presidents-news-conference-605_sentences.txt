In the Washington Evening Star of February 23 a news item states that a change had been made in the official transcript of the President's remarks at the dinner honoring General Vaughan (Item 36); that in the paragraph toward the close which begins "Now, I am just as fond and just as loyal" the President had used the expression "any SOB" instead of the milder "anyone" which appears in the release.
Sentence 118: The editorial referred to, which appears in the same edition of the Star, follows:
"Blankety Blank, Mr. President!
Sentence 119: "Our language is plagued with initials already.
Sentence 120: They drive a man wild.
Sentence 121: Reading a newspaper story is becoming a frightful experience, trying to remember what is meant by such terms as ERP, ECA, BLS, CARE, OEM, WAA, IMF, WHO, UNO.
Sentence 122: Now the President, unfortunately, has got into the habit of speaking in the same lingo.
Sentence 123: The Star protests.
Sentence 124: Why, if he wants to bring it into a public speech at all, does he not say "The Senate Office Building" instead of reducing the term to such a meaningless symbol as SOB?

Sentence 126: The President has gone too far."
