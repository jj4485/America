Sentence 25: Q.
Sentence 26: Well, specifically, Mr. President, Senator Thomas yesterday said that he expects that there will be a request for a billion additional for military expenditures in a week or so?

Sentence 77: Q. Well, Mr. President, can you comment in general on the outlook in Korea?
Sentence 78: Last week you said you were hopeful--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 79: I feel the same way.

Sentence 92: --let me tell you something--
Q.

Sentence 100: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: We will be able to retain a foothold in Korea as far north as the 38th parallel.

Sentence 116: I wish you would make that perfectly plain to your subscribers.
Sentence 117: Q. Mr. President, we talked to Mr. Brannan this morning about that, and he said it would be a reasonable deduction that rising prices would be due to profiteering.
Sentence 118: Do you agree with that?
Sentence 119: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 120: I do.
Sentence 121: The statement I just made you would show that that is true.

Q.
Sentence 124: He denied it.
Sentence 125: Q. Would you like to comment on the hoarding, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 127: Q. There are reports of hoarding of food and various other commodities.
Sentence 128: Would you like to make a statement?
Sentence 129: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 130: I think it is very foolish to start anything of that kind now.
Sentence 131: There is no necessity for it whatever, as I am trying to make perfectly plain to you.
Sentence 132: Q. Mr. President, would your remarks apply also to consumer goods, like automobiles and other--

Sentence 142: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 143: Yes, both.
Sentence 144: Q. Thank you, sir.
Sentence 145: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 146: I am considering everything in connection with this situation which I think will be helpful in keeping the American people and the Congress informed on what goes on.
Sentence 147: Q. Mr. President, are we doing anything to urge the participation of ground troops of other nations in--

Sentence 167: [16.]

Sentence 172: Q. Mr. President, in view of the present situation, is there anything to speed up the machinery of the North Atlantic Pact being urged also on the other partners?
