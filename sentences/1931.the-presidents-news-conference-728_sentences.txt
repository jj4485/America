Sentence 1: 1931 The Presidents News Conference 728

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have two questions--one on Honduras and the other on Nicaragua.
Sentence 3: HONDURAS
On Honduras
Sentence 4: we have no news other than what you have already in the press this morning.
Sentence 5: NICARAGUAN BANDIT ACTIVITY
On Nicaragua our advices are that the Nicaraguan Government has now placed in the field a total of something over 1,300 men in the newly organized National Guard in a drive to clean up [Augusto Cesar]
Sentence 6: Sandino and his fellow bandits.
Sentence 7: Our representatives also advise that this force is several times the size of Mr. Sandino's group.
Sentence 8: His raids on important points have been frustrated by the disposition which has been made of the guard and the protection of our citizens on the coast has been doubly sure by the presence of naval vessels.
Sentence 9: Sandino placed himself and his band outside the civilized pale by the coldblooded murder of eight or nine American citizens and many Nicaraguans at isolated places in the interior.
Sentence 10: The Nicaraguan Government has shown itself fully cognizant of its responsibilities.
Sentence 11: It is moving vigorously in spite of the difficulties created by the earthquake.
Sentence 12: It may require some time to accomplish their purpose due to the mountainous and jungle character of the territory in which Sandino operates, but I am perfectly confident that Sandino will be brought to justice.
Sentence 13: Otherwise than that I have no news.
