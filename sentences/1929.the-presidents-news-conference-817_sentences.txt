Sentence 4: LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMISSION
One of them is as to whether Justice
Sentence 5: [Harlan Fiske] Stone has been selected for the Law Enforcement Commission.
Sentence 6: I think every one of the Justices of the Supreme Court have been suggested for that commission and nearly every circuit judge in the United States for one of those positions; and that is the extent to which that has gone.

Sentence 8: Q. Mr. President, may I ask a question?
Sentence 9: Wouldn't he have to resign from the bench ?
Sentence 10: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 12: "I'M ALONE" ARBITRATION
The other question is whether we have appointed an arbitrator for the I'm Alone commission.
Sentence 13: We have not.
Sentence 14: At least I have no recommendation from Secretary Stimson.
Sentence 15: MEDITERRANEAN FRUIT FLY
The other relates to the Mediterranean fruit fly in Florida.
Sentence 16: We have sent recommendations to Congress to make an emergency appropriation to deal with this particular pest because it is probably the most [p.126] dangerous thing that has attacked American horticulture.
Sentence 17: It is regarded by all of the experts as probably the greatest menace that could come into American horticulture, and the proposal of the Government is to spend the money to stamp it out instantly without dilly-dallying with it at all.
Sentence 18: We have asked Congress for $4 million and propose to go right after it.
Sentence 19: That is all that I have--that I am able to give you.
