THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: As soon as he gets through with the--winds up the situation in the Navy.
Sentence 34: That is--I suppose some time soon.
Sentence 35: Whenever he is ready to--he is going to take the oath.
Sentence 36: I will let you know whenever the matter takes place.

Sentence 52: Q. Mr. President, have you anything to add to the high-price investigation

Sentence 55: I am wholeheartedly in favor of it.
Sentence 56: Q. Mr. President, may I ask you to have him read that question again?
Sentence 57: THE PRESIDENT, On what?
Q. Investigation of high prices ?
Sentence 58: Mr. Romagna: "Mr. President, have you anything to add to the high-price investigation"--
Q.
Sentence 59: Oh yes.
Sentence 60: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 61: That's the investigation of high prices, not the high-price investigation!
Sentence 62: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, do you think that the Attorney General's investigation can actually check the rise of prices, or will it merely point the finger as to who is responsible for it?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 63: I think the second part of your question is probably what would happen.
Sentence 64: Q. That that in itself would probably not check-
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 65: Have to wait and see what the results would be.
Sentence 66: Q. Mr. President, do you believe that it's the violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust law that are responsible for high prices ?
Sentence 67: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 68: I can't answer that until the investigation has found the answer.
Sentence 69: That is what the investigation is for.
Sentence 70: [8.]
Sentence 71: Q. Mr. President, have you any comment on the state of the world 2 years after V-J Day?
Sentence 72: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 73: Well, I was thinking when the press conference was called that it was--accidentally happened to be on the anniversary of the surrender of the Japanese.
Sentence 74: I think the announcement was made to you, as I remember, about 7 o'clock in the afternoon, and I had anticipated at that time that we would have arrived at a peaceful settlement of affairs in the world.
Sentence 75: I regret to say that we have not arrived at that situation.
Sentence 76: I am still hopeful that we will have peace in the world that will be for the benefit of all the peoples of the world, as I stated, I think, in my V-J Day announcement.
Sentence 77: [9.]
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, there has been a lot of after thinking, and recently Colonel Fellers, who was a brigadier general under MacArthur out there, had a piece in which he insisted that the dropping of the atomic bomb was unnecessary, that the war had been won before that time.
Sentence 79: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 80: When I was going to school we were discussing the battle of Gettysburg, and a very bright young man got up and stated the maneuvers that should have been made by General Lee and those that should have been made by General Meade, in order to make a complete victory at that point.
Sentence 81: And the old professor made the statement that any schoolboy's afterthought is worth more than all the generals' forethought.
Sentence 82: And that is true in the case you state.
Sentence 83: [Laughter]
Q. So far as you are concerned, you have never had any doubt that it was necessary?
Sentence 84: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 85: I have never had any doubt that it was necessary, and I didn't have any doubt at the time.
Sentence 86: I hated very much to have to make that decision.
Sentence 87: Anybody would.
Sentence 88: But I thought that decision was made in the interest of saving about 250,000 American boys from getting killed, and I still think that was true.
Sentence 89: [10.]
Sentence 90: Q. Mr. President, would you be in favor of Secretary Anderson for Democratic National Chairman, if Mr. Hannegan doesn't stay on?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: Well now, Tony,
1
I can't answer a question like that.
Sentence 92: [Laughter] The next time the Democratic Committee meets, they will probably decide on a chairman.
Sentence 93: I think very highly of Secretary Anderson, of course, but I am not naming him as Chairman of the Committee, Tony.
Sentence 94: A trick question like that!
Sentence 95: [More laughter]
Q.
Sentence 96: I just wanted to clarify my thinking.
Sentence 97: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 98: That's all right, Tony.
Sentence 99: [To another reporter] Go ahead.
Sentence 100: 1
Ernest B. Vaccaro of the Associated Press.
Sentence 101: Q. Could I ask this?
Sentence 102: Mr. President, there has been a report that if Mr. Anderson does make that move, you are going to appoint Roy Thompson as Secretary of Agriculture.
Sentence 103: Any idea--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: That's the first I've heard of that.
Sentence 105: There is no vacancy in the Department of Agriculture yet.
Sentence 106: [11.]
Sentence 107: Q. Mr. President, can you comment on the British political and financial situation?

Sentence 111: I have no comment.
Sentence 112: [12.]
Sentence 113: Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on the CIO request that you call a conference of management and labor and industry to discuss rolling back prices?
Sentence 114: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 115: I have no comment on that.
Sentence 116: I made an attempt at that in November 1945.
Sentence 117: It was not successful.
Sentence 118: [13.]
Sentence 119: Q. Mr. President, do you foresee success of the Rio conference which opens tomorrow ?
Sentence 120: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 122: I made that statement, I think, to General Marshall yesterday.
Sentence 123: [14.]
Sentence 124: Q. Mr. President, do you see any circumstances between now and, say, Christmas such as to change your opinion that a special session might not be necessary?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 125: Nothing on the horizon at the present time.
Sentence 126: [15.]
Sentence 127: Q.
Sentence 128: Any further details on the Rio trip, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 129: No, I can't give you any details yet.
Sentence 130: As soon as I can, why I will furnish you with all the details.
Sentence 131: Q. Learning any Portuguese or Spanish?
Sentence 132: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 133: I don't know either Portuguese or Spanish, so it won't be necessary, any such comment as that.
Sentence 134: Q. Mr. President, when you go to Brazil, is there any plan for you to meet the Presidents of any other countries except the President of Brazil?

Sentence 135: NO.
Sentence 136: [16.]
Sentence 137: Q. Mr. President, are you giving any consideration to possible transfer of the Unemployment Compensation Division to the Labor Department?
Sentence 138: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 139: Yes, I have been giving it a lot of consideration right along.
Sentence 140: Q. Get the USES and the Unemployment Compensation Division together in one place?
Sentence 141: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 142: They should be in one place, undoubtedly.
Sentence 143: Q.
Sentence 144: To rebuild the Labor Department?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: Well, we will rebuild the Labor Department, don't worry about that.
Sentence 146: It can't be torn--permanently torn up any more than any other Department can.
Sentence 147: Q.
Sentence 148: Do you think it is sort of torn up at the moment ?
Sentence 149: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: Yes I do.
Sentence 151: Yes I do.
Sentence 152: I think that is one of the accomplishments of the last Congress.
Sentence 153: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, I notice that one of the 1944 Republican platforms was to take all the--put under the Secretary of Labor once again, they said, all the labor and independent agencies.
Sentence 154: That is correct?
Sentence 155: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 156: That's the Republican platform.
Sentence 157: I can give you the chapter and verse, if you want it.
Sentence 158: Q. Have you any comment on that?
Sentence 159: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 160: None.
Sentence 161: None whatever.
Sentence 162: It speaks for itself.
Sentence 163: [17.]
Sentence 164: Q. Mr. President, would you favor a west coast city for the National Convention ?

Sentence 167: [18.]
Sentence 168: Q. Mr. President, have you got those supplemental budget estimates in view of the Congress appropriations?
Sentence 169: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 170: I will have that information ready for you, I hope, inside of the next 10 or 15 days, and I will furnish it to you.
Sentence 171: It isn't ready yet.
Sentence 172: Q. Will you announce it, or the Budget Director?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 173: The Budget Director, in all probability, will make his report to me, and I will announce it to you.
Sentence 174: Q. Mr. President--what was that, Mr. president?
Sentence 175: We were a little bit behind.
Sentence 176: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 177: On the budget figures, as to estimates.
Sentence 178: I made the statement sometime--I think at the last press conference or the one before that, that as soon as we could get the figures together, I would tell you exactly what happened so you could understand and so I could understand them.
Sentence 179: Q. Mr. President, in that connection, the Budget Director is reported to have sent a message to the departments saying that the--referring to the 1949 estimates in terms of rigid economy.
Sentence 180: I wonder if that was done on your direction?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 181: Yes, those are the same instructions that were given the departments last year.
Sentence 182: Just a repeat.
Sentence 183: [19.]
Sentence 184: Q. I hate to ask you to repeat again that little description you had about the afterthought.
Sentence 185: What was it that the teacher said to you ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 186: The teacher said to me that any schoolboy's afterthought is worth more than all the greatest generals' forethought.
Sentence 187: Q. I see.
Sentence 188: Thank you.
Sentence 189: [20.]
Sentence 190: Q. Mr. President, in connection with your statement on the failure of peace 2 years after the end of the war, I wonder if you would care to elaborate on what is holding up peace, what might be done about it?
Sentence 191: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 192: I don't think I should elaborate on that, because we are trying to get the peace, and I don't think any comment I made at this time would be helpful in that direction.
Sentence 193: [21.]
Sentence 194: Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on the present status of the old Truman committee?
Sentence 195: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 196: No, I have not.
Sentence 197: The Truman committee passed out when I resigned.
Sentence 198: It's another committee.
Sentence 199: [22.]
Sentence 200: Q. Mr. President, will you have any budget figures in the next 10 or 15 days for some estimates on potential outlays under the so-called Marshall plan?
Sentence 201: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 202: NO, no, We can't figure any potential estimates of that until we have finished the surveys which are now being needed for that purpose.
Sentence 203: The Paris conference will have one side of it, and our own economic setup which they--which I sent up for the purpose will give us the other.
Sentence 204: Then I will give you the facts and figures as soon as I have them.
Sentence 205: Q. Then would those--would that midyear revision then have to be revised some time later in the year on the basis of whatever outlays will have to be made for Europe?
Sentence 206: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 207: I don't understand your question.
Sentence 208: You will have to make it a little clearer.
Sentence 209: Q. Well, the midyear estimates usually mean a pretty firm set of figures for the balance of the year.
Sentence 210: If the Marshall plan figures can't be included, will there be a real set of figures to show an overall picture of the effect of the European part of it on our budget?
Sentence 211: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 212: Well, when the Marshall plan figures are ready, of course they will have an effect on the budget, but I don't think there is any midyear estimate that is contemplated to be made now.
Sentence 213: Q.
Sentence 214: In that connection, Mr. President, does the United States--is the United States taking any notice of the clamor on the part of Western Hemisphere nations for a Marshall plan, as it were, of their own?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 215: Well, I think there has always been a Marshall plan in effect for the Western Hemisphere.
Sentence 216: The foreign policy of the United States in that direction has been set for one hundred years, known as the Monroe Doctrine.
Sentence 217: [23.]
Sentence 218: Q. Mr. President, is it true that you really laid the law down to the new members of the NLRB, and made it clear to them that they are members of the executive department rather than--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 219: We discussed the situation, and I find that--I found that they were in the same frame of mind that I am, that they are a branch of the executive department of the Government.
Sentence 220: We have no argument on the subject, and I didn't have to lay any law down.
Sentence 221: Reporter:
Sentence 222: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 223: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 224: You're welcome.
