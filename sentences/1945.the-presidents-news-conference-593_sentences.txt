Sentence 50: President Roosevelt had ordered the Navy Department to go to work on a new flag just before he died, and I thought maybe you might be interested in the history of the Presidential flag and the Presidential seal; and I have got a release for you in mimeographed form on that.
Sentence 51: [To General Vaughan] Now raise that flag up, there.
Sentence 52: This flag here--in President Wilson's time there were two flags for the President, an Army flag for the President with a red star and a Navy flag for the President with a blue star.
Sentence 53: President Wilson ordered a single flag for the President, and this was the result of that--[General Vaughan displays flag]--with the white eagle facing toward the arrows, which is the sinister side of the heraldic form, and no color.
Sentence 54: This new flag--[to General Vaughan]--if you will raise that one up, now you will see--you can see the difference.
Sentence 55: It will all be explained in the release which you will get.
Sentence 56: This new flag faces the eagle toward the staff which is looking to the front all the time when you are on the march, and also has him looking at the olive branches for peace, instead of the arrows for war; and taking the 4 stars out of the corner and putting 48 stars around the Presidential seal.
Sentence 57: You will get a release that will tell you all about it, and the why and the wherefore.

The release contained the text of Executive Order 9646 "Coat of Arms, Seal, and Flag of the President of the United States" (October 25, 1945, 3 CFR, 1943-1948 Comp., p. 445), together with background material reading in part as follows:
The Executive order establishes for the first time a legal definition of the President's coat of arms and his seal.
Sentence 58: The design of the coat of arms and the seal has been changed slightly from the former design, and the Presidential flag has also been changed.
Sentence 59: The flag will consist of the coat of arms in full color, surrounded by 48 white stars on a blue field.
Sentence 60: The former Presidential flag was adopted in 1916 by President Wilson.
Sentence 61: Prior to that time, the Army and the Navy had had separate flags for the Commander in Chief.
Sentence 62: President Wilson instructed his Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the Aide to the Secretary of the Navy, Commander Byron McCandless, USN, to design a Presidential flag which would be suitable for use by both the Army and the Navy.
Sentence 63: On May 29, 1916, President Wilson signed an Executive order adopting the flag suggested by Assistant Secretary Roosevelt and Commander McCandless.
Sentence 64: The flag consisted of the Presidential coat of arms on a blue field with a white star in each of the corners.
Sentence 65: That flag was in use from 1916 until today.
Sentence 66: In March of this year, President Roosevelt discussed with his Naval Aide, Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, the advisability of changing the President's flag.
Sentence 67: It seemed inappropriate to President Roosevelt for the flag of the Commander in Chief to have only four stars when there were five stars In the flags of Fleet Admirals and Generals of the Army, grades which had been created in December 1944.
Sentence 68: It was natural that President Roosevelt should turn at this time to the officer who had worked with him in 1916, and who now holds the rank of Commodore, Byron McCandless.
Sentence 69: For many years Commodore McCandless, who now commands the U.S. Naval Repair Base at San Diego, Calif., has studied the histories of the various flags of the United States.
Sentence 70: When Vice Admiral Brown wrote to him, at President Roosevelt's request, late In March for suggestions for a new design for the President's flag, Commodore McCandless prepared several designs based upon early American flags.
Sentence 71: His proposed designs arrived in Washington after the death of President Roosevelt and the President did not have the opportunity of seeing them until early in June.
Sentence 72: The President and members of his staff examined them carefully and, preferring one design to the others, the President made several suggestions to Commodore McCandless concerning it.
Sentence 73: The President believed that all of the States in the Union should be represented on the Commander in Chief's flag, and he asked Commodore McCandless to submit a new design with a circle of 48 stars around the coat of arms.
Sentence 74: Commodore McCandless sent a painting of the proposed flag, with the circle of 48 stars, to the White House in July and when the President returned from Berlin in August, he tentatively approved that design.
Sentence 75: It was then sent to the War and Navy Departments for comment and suggestions.
Sentence 76: The Chief of the Heraldic Section of the Office of the Quartermaster General of the Army, Mr. Arthur E. DuBois, like Commodore McCandless, has studied the history of flags and heraldic emblems for many years.
Sentence 77: Mr. DuBois made several suggestions to the President.
Sentence 78: He pointed out that there was no known basis In law for the coat of arms and the seal which has been used by Presidents since 1880 and which was reproduced on the flag.
Sentence 79: The seal had originated during the administration of President Hayes, apparently as an erroneous rendering of the Great Seal of the United States.
Sentence 80: It is a curious fact that the eagle on the Great Seal faces to its own right, whereas the eagle on the seal in use by Presidents since 1880 faces to its own left.
Sentence 81: According to heraldic custom, the eagle on a coat of arms, unless otherwise specified in the heraldic description, is always made to face to its own right.
Sentence 82: There is no explanation for the eagle facing to its own left In the case of the President's coat of arms.
Sentence 83: To conform to heraldic custom, and since there was no authority other than usage for the former Presidential coat of arms, the President had Mr. DuBois redesign the coat of arms in accordance with the latter's suggestions.
Sentence 84: In the new coat of arms, seal and flag, the eagle not only faces to its right--the direction of honor--but also toward the olive branches of peace which it holds in its right talon.
Sentence 85: Formerly the eagle faced toward the arrows in its left talon-arrows, symbolic of
The President also decided that the eagle on his seal and his flag should appear in the full color of the natural bird as is customary in most flags, rather than in white appear as it had been on the former flag.
Sentence 86: The 48 stars in the circle represent the States collectively; no single star represents any particular State.
Sentence 87: Now I am ready for questions.
Sentence 88: [6.]
Sentence 89: Q. Mr. President, can we clear up a little bit about the November trips?
Sentence 90: Is the southern trip still on?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: It is; unless conditions here are such that require my presence here.
Sentence 92: All Presidential trips are tentative.
Sentence 93: Q. Mr. President, will you go to Waco, Texas, December 5 ?
Sentence 94: Is that decided?
Sentence 95: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 96: That is another tentative appointment.
Sentence 97: They have asked me to come down and get a degree of Doctor of Laws from the great Baptist school down there, and I am inclined to go.
Sentence 98: [7.]
Sentence 99: Q. Mr. President, have you decided as yet to accept the resignation of John Snyder?
Sentence 100: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: John Snyder's resignation has never been under contemplation.
Sentence 102: John Snyder will stay with me as long as I want him, and until his job is finished.
Sentence 103: Q.
Sentence 104: He hasn't resigned to you in a letter, sir?
Sentence 105: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 106: No, sir.
Sentence 107: He never made any attempt to.
Sentence 108: Q. Thank you very much.
Sentence 109: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 110: He is a patriotic citizen, and he will stay here as long as I need him, although he is doing it at a very great sacrifice.
Sentence 111: [8.]
Sentence 112: Q. Mr. President, the Washington Post this morning suggested that General Marshall be placed in charge of the program for universal military training.
Sentence 113: Granted that he needs a rest, but that he ought to add his prestige to that.
Sentence 114: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 115: I think General Marshall will add his prestige to that universal training program, but General Marshall is still the Chief of Staff, and I need him as Chief of Staff.
Sentence 116: [9.]
Sentence 117: Q. Mr. President, what would be the betting odds on whether you go to Georgia or not?
Sentence 118: [Laughter] Those people are worrying us to death.
Sentence 119: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 143: I haven't made up my mind on the directors for the Export-Import Bank.
Sentence 144: I have been considering Mr. Crowley for a member of that Board.
Sentence 145: Q. Mr. President, on that point, there still seems to be some mystery about Mr. Crowley's departure from both the FDIC and the FEA.
Sentence 146: He wrote a letter specifically resigning from the FDIC.
Sentence 147: You accepted both resignations.
Sentence 148: Two Congressmen have told me that he testified that there was an additional letter dealing with his reasons for wanting to get out of FEA, and that it was up to the White House to release that.
Sentence 149: Would you release that letter now?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 150: The letter is around here somewhere, but our conversations were verbal--sitting here in that chair; and the only reason I accepted Mr. Crowley's release was because he insisted on giving it to me, and said that he had been in public service for a long time, and he would like to be in a position to attend to his own business a little while.
Sentence 151: I didn't urge him in any way.
Sentence 152: Q.
Sentence 153: But is there any reason why that letter should not be public knowledge?
