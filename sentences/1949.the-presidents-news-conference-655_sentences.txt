Sentence 1: 1949 The Presidents News Conference 655

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: [1.]
Sentence 3: I have a statement for you--getting to be a habit here lately.
Sentence 4: Saves a lot of questions, I find, though, if you clear them up before you start.
Sentence 5: [Reading]: "The Department of State is publishing tomorrow a volume on the United States relations with China, particularly during the last 5 years.
Sentence 6: I asked the Secretary of State to have this record compiled and published.
Sentence 7: 1
1
United States Relations With China: With Special Reference to the Period 1944-1949.
Sentence 8: Based on the files of the Department of State.
Sentence 9: Department of State Publication 3573.
Sentence 10: Far Eastern Series 30.
Sentence 11: (Government Printing Office, 1949, 1054 pp.).
Sentence 12: "My primary purpose in having this frank and factual record released at this time is to insure that our policy toward China and the Far East as a whole shall be based on informed and intelligent public opinion.
Sentence 13: This is the way in which our system of government acquires its strength.
Sentence 14: As I said in the speech at Chicago last month, 'Only if men know the truth are they in a position to work for a stable and peaceful world.'
Sentence 15: 'In this nation, foreign policy is not made by the decisions of a few.
Sentence 16: It is the result of the democratic process, and represents the collective judgment of the people.'
Sentence 17: "The role of this Government in its relations with China has been subject to considerable misrepresentation, distortion, and misunderstanding.
Sentence 18: Some of these attitudes arose because this Government was reluctant to reveal certain facts, the publication of which might have served to hasten the events in China which have now occurred.
Sentence 19: In the present situation, however, the mutual interests of the United States and China require full and frank discussion of the facts.
Sentence 20: It is only in this way that the people of our country and their representatives in Congress can have the understanding necessary to the sound evolution of our foreign policy in the Far East.
Sentence 21: "The Secretary of State in transmitting this record has made a clear and illuminating statement of the situation that exists in China, the nature of the problems that are presented, and the governing principles of our policies toward China.
Sentence 22: This statement will also be published and should be read, with the record, by everyone who is interested in problems of the Far East.
Sentence 23: "The warm feeling of friendship between the people of the United States and the people of China has been one of the most notable facts in American foreign relations.
Sentence 24: That friendship is as strong today as it has ever been.
Sentence 25: The problem of finding ways to give practical expression to that friendship will continue to receive, day in and day out, the closest attention of this Government, and I know that it will receive the hopeful, constructive, forward-looking thought of the American people."
Sentence 26: Now this China paper will be ready for distribution to the press at 2 o'clock today, at the State Department, and I will show you what a nice chore you are going to have.
Sentence 27: [Laughter] There it is.
Sentence 28: And it's complete and factual, and there's everything in it that you want to know about the China policy from the 1840's to the present day.
Sentence 29: And if you will take the time to carefully read and study it, you will know just about as much about China policy as the President does, and I think I know more about it than anybody else.
Sentence 30: Q. Mr. President, does that include the Wedemeyer report?
Sentence 31: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 32: It includes everything, and that's in there in toto.
Sentence 33: And everything that General Marshall ever did is in there, and anybody else you want to ask about.
Sentence 34: Even General Hurley is in there, in toto.
Sentence 35: [Laughter ]
Q. Mr. President, the present controversy over the American policy, as I see it--and I think possibly as you see it, too, aside from your official knowledge--is that we were too slow in doing something for China because of Communist influence in Washington, or Red influence, and that's--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 36: Now, that question--that question is thoroughly and completely answered in there; and it was an entirely erroneous understanding.
Sentence 37: Q. You recognize the question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: Yes, I recognize the question, and where it came from; but read this
Sentence 39: and then you will have it.
Sentence 40: Q. Mr. President, are we allowed to take any new steps in China on China policy?
Sentence 41: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 42: Read the China policy book.
Sentence 43: Q. Does that include the recent conferences between President Quirino and General Chiang?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 44: Everything that is necessary is in this book.
Sentence 45: [2.]
Sentence 46: Q. Mr. President, we are told that Mrs. Roosevelt has written to you and offered to resign her UN job because of the Spellman controversy?
2
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: Mrs. Roosevelt every year offers to resign from her job on the UN, just because she thinks that the President ought to have a free hand to make an appointment.
Sentence 48: There was--she expressed no reason as to why she wanted to resign.
Sentence 49: Simply a matter of courtesy to me.
Sentence 50: 2
See note in Item 166 [8].
Sentence 51: Q. Will you accept, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 52: She is going back to the UN.
Sentence 53: [3.]
Sentence 54: Q. Mr. President, Mr. Hoffman and Secretary Sawyer have endorsed the idea of an international trade fair in some American city in the United States, to stimulate imports and to stimulate exports.
Sentence 55: According to reports, I think Atlantic City and Detroit have been mentioned as having made considerable progress towards establishing such a fair.
Sentence 56: Would you favor it for 1950?
Sentence 57: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: I think it would be a fine thing.
Sentence 59: I am not picking any cities, however.
Sentence 60: Q. Mr. President, I got lost somewhere along in that question.
Sentence 61: I was just wondering if we could--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 62: An international fair-proposal for an international fair to be held some time in 1950 in the United States, to make sales of our products easier and to make imports easier so that one could offset the other.
Sentence 63: Sort of like the European fairs that have been held for generations.
Sentence 64: [4.]
Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, Representative Klein of New York said yesterday, after seeing Mr. Steelman, that you might have something to say shortly on the excise tax question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 66: I have seen the "Big Four," and they quoted me correctly at the front door of the White House, that it will require a great deal of research by the experts of the Ways and Means Committee, and the Finance Committee of the Senate, and the Treasury Department, before we can approach the excise tax problem as it should be; and it will be at least the next session before anything will be done about excise taxes.
Sentence 67: [5.]
Sentence 68: Q. Mr. President, have you any suggestions for the Republicans who are now trying to pick a new chairman?
Sentence 69: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: It would not be proper for me to interfere in the affairs of the Republican Party--except in a campaign.
Sentence 71: [6.]
Sentence 72: Q. Mr. President, do you wish to comment on published reports that the United States Navy is planning another expedition to Antarctica?
Sentence 73: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: I have no comment on that.
Sentence 75: In fact, I don't know anything about it.
Sentence 76: It hasn't been put up to me.
Sentence 77: [7.]
Sentence 78: Q. Mr. President, did you see where Colonel Hunt bought 2500 books of matches from St. Louis "Swiped From Harry S. Truman"?
Sentence 79: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 80: Anybody has a right to buy matches anywhere with anything on them that he wants to have put on them.
Sentence 81: That's the first I ever heard about that one.
Sentence 82: [8.]
Sentence 83: Q. Mr. President, the President of the Philippines will be here Monday--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 84: That's right.
Sentence 85: Q.--for conferences with you--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 86: I shall meet him at 4:30, as I always meet the heads of States.
Sentence 87: We shall have conferences at the Blair House, and he will have dinner with me that night, and the next night I will have dinner with him at the Philippine Embassy.
Sentence 88: Q. Do you care to make any comment as to the possible topics of discussion?
Sentence 89: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 90: Whatever the President of the Philippines desires to discuss with the President of the United States will be discussed.
Sentence 91: [9.]
Sentence 92: Q. Mr. President, would you accept a compromise on your arms aid proposal?
Sentence 93: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 94: The arms aid proposal ought to be passed--in the manner in which it was sent down, except for maybe legislative changes that will make it easier to handle--as quickly as possible.
Sentence 95: Q. Mr. President, there has been considerable debate and criticism of section 3 of the arms aid bill, on the ground that it gives you blank check power.
Sentence 96: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: I don't care anything about blank check power.
Sentence 98: All I want is to have an arms aid program so that it will work in a practical manner.
Sentence 99: Q.
Sentence 100: You are opposed to a compromise on the sum?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 101: The money, yes.
Sentence 102: The money thing.
Sentence 103: Q.
Sentence 104: When you say blank check, that is giving aid to any country?
Sentence 105: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 106: I don't particularly care whether that's in there or not.
Sentence 107: They are working on that situation now.
Sentence 108: All I want is that the European pact countries can be properly taken care of on rearmament, with our help, to implement the treaty so that it will be worth something.
Sentence 109: [10.]
Sentence 110: Q. On the Mexican oil question that has come up several times recently, there is a report out now that the United States refused the loan because Mexico would not pay some back claims--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 111: The United States has not refused the loan.
Sentence 112: It is still under consideration, and I am hopeful that the loan can be worked out.
Sentence 113: [11.]
Sentence 114: Q. Mr. President, has Secretary Sawyer reported to you on his regional conference on business conditions?
Sentence 115: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 116: He has reported to me on his visit to New England.
Sentence 117: He hasn't returned yet.
Sentence 118: He will report to me again, as soon as he does return.
Sentence 119: I can't make any comment on it until I see the full report.
Sentence 120: Q. Mr. President, do you see any improvement in business conditions?
Sentence 121: THE PRESIDENT, All I know is what I read in the papers, and even the Wall Street Journal says there is an improvement.
Sentence 122: [Laughter]
Sentence 123: [12.]
Sentence 124: Q. Mr. President, on the China situation, do you see any possibility of China being rescued from the Communists?
Sentence 125: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 126: I can't comment on that.
Sentence 127: I would advise you to read the book, and you will get, then, the viewpoint just the same as I have.
Sentence 128: [13.]
Sentence 129: Q. Mr. President, you are about to sign the unification bill?
Sentence 130: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: It hasn't got to my desk yet.
Sentence 132: I am having it analyzed, and when it comes to my desk properly analyzed, if it's in the form that I think it is, I will probably sign it.
Sentence 133: 3

See Item 177.
Sentence 134: [14.]
Sentence 135: Mr. Ross [to the President]: I think that Quirino dinner is at the Statler Hotel.
Sentence 136: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 137: What?
Mr. Ross: That dinner for President Quirino.
Sentence 138: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 139: Charlie says that the dinner for the President of the Philippines will be at the Statler Hotel.
Sentence 140: I was misinformed on it.
Sentence 141: The reason it's at the Statler is because of course we can't have it at the White House, and the Blair House is too small-not big enough.
Sentence 142: [15.]
Sentence 143: Q. Mr. President, I am just trying to clear up about those matches.
Sentence 144: Did you get your matches from Colonel Hunt?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 145: No, I did not.
Sentence 146: I don't know Colonel Hunt.
Sentence 147: Q.
Sentence 148: Can you tell us how you get them, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 149: Oh, they come in every once in a while.
Sentence 150: People come in, sometimes, and hand me a box of them.
Sentence 151: Did you ever receive any matches?
Sentence 152: Q. Yes sir--I got one from you.
Sentence 153: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 154: I get boxes of matches from friends.
Sentence 155: They come to the White House all the time.
Sentence 156: We have a special brand particularly for the White House.
Sentence 157: [16.]
Sentence 158: Q. Mr. President, when you refer to the international trade fair, is that officially supported by the United States Government, or is that--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 159: It's in the embryo stage yet.
Sentence 160: Nothing official has been done about it.
Sentence 161: It's being talked about.
Sentence 162: Probably will be in the hands of the city that wants to have it, just as any world's fair is.
Sentence 163: [17.]
Sentence 164: Q. One other thing I want to clear up, when you said Mrs. Roosevelt will go back, you mean she will be the delegate to the next UN session?
Sentence 165: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 166: Next Assembly.
Sentence 167: Q. Next Assembly.
Sentence 168: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 169: Just the same job she always has.
Sentence 170: Q. Did that offer of resignation come at the usual time?
Sentence 171: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 172: Yes.
Sentence 173: Every year she always resigns.
Sentence 174: She tells me that if I want to appoint somebody else in her place, she will not be unhappy about it.
Sentence 175: Very formal.
Sentence 176: Just the customary formal politeness that Ambassadors and Delegates of the President always put forth.
Sentence 177: Reporter:
Sentence 178: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 179: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 180: You're welcome.
