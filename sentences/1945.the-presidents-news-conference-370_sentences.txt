Sentence 1: 1945
Sentence 2: The Presidents News Conference 370

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 3: Well, I have got two short statements I want to read to you to start things off with.
Sentence 4: [1.]
Sentence 5: [Reading, not literally]: "Secretary Morgenthau has told me about the shocking cases of tax evasion his men have discovered, and I am thoroughly in sympathy with his plan to enlarge the Bureau of Internal Revenue forces to whatever extent is required to insure full compliance with the law.
Sentence 6: 1

At this point the statement, as released by the White House, continues as follows: "It will be good business for the Government, because every dollar we spend in collection and enforcement will produce $20 or more in revenue.
Sentence 7: And much more important is the matter of good morals.
Sentence 8: We are not fighting this war to make millionaires, and certainly we are not going to allow the black market operators or any other racketeers to be in a favored class, when the men in the armed forces, and our citizens generally, are sacrificing so heavily."
Sentence 9: "Yesterday, I acquainted the top officials of the Civil Service Commission with our special tax drive and the necessity for an accelerated program of recruitment.
Sentence 10: Arrangements have been made with the Civil Service Commission to have placed at every Army discharge center in the United States a qualified recruitment officer from the Civil Service Commission, fully versed in our recruitment requirements, who will steer to us the qualified veterans as they are discharged.
Sentence 11: "

The following final paragraph appears in the White House release of the statement: "The American people understand that sacrifices are necessary.
Sentence 12: They know the war is still far from being over.
Sentence 13: The one thing that might break down their will to keep on to complete victory would be a feeling that a few were profiting from the sacrifices of the many.
Sentence 14: We must see that there is no justification for any such feeling, and that is just what we are going to do.
Sentence 15: "
I think there will be enough discharged veterans, probably, with the qualifications to meet this 10,000-man-program that Mr. Morgenthau is asking for.
Sentence 16: It is a crime to--a terrible crime, in my opinion, to find these people who are hoarding money and living off the black markets, and things of that sort, when the sons of the rest of the population are out getting killed to save the country.
Sentence 17: And we are going to try to put a stop to it.
Sentence 18: I have another short statement I would like to make, with regard to prisoners of war.
Sentence 19: [2.]
Sentence 20: [Reading]: "I wish to express my very deep sympathy for the relatives of those members of our armed forces who have the misfortune still to be held as prisoners of war by the enemy.
Sentence 21: The welfare of these men is a matter of deep concern to me, and I am determined to do everything possible to help them and to bring about their release as soon as possible.
Sentence 22: "To this end, every effort is being made to get relief supplies and mail through to them.
Sentence 23: At the same time, definitive information is being sought concerning the names of those men who are still held as prisoners of war.
Sentence 24: The eventual liberation of these prisoners will be the result of the victory of our armed forces, and depends upon unrelenting prosecution of the war effort by every American.
Sentence 25: "
These prisoners, of course, are the ones that are held by the Japanese.
Sentence 26: There are still a great many of our men who were captured in the Philippines, who are held in Manchuria and other places.
Sentence 27: We are trying our best to do what we can for them under the circumstances.
Sentence 28: And I hope we will really get something done for them.
Sentence 29: Now, if you have any questions you want to ask, I will try to answer them.
Sentence 30: [3.]
Sentence 31: Q. Mr. President, will you talk to us about universal military training this morning, and your views on it ?
Sentence 32: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: I have made a--I have had a conference on universal military training with some Members of the House and the Senate, and we are now trying to work out a policy on it.
Sentence 34: I would rather not discuss it at length this morning, although when I have the thing really in form, I will be glad to give it to you.
Sentence 35: And I have got a few views on universal military training of my own, which don't agree with the Army, and don't agree with the Navy, and don't agree with the House or Senate, so I will try to get them in shape so that we will--.
Sentence 36: I would rather wait for another time and give you a complete statement on that.
Sentence 37: [4.]
Sentence 38: Q. Mr. President, have you been receiving a great deal of mail on the subject of these war prisoners?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 39: Yes, yes.
Sentence 40: We have received an enormous amount of mail.
Sentence 41: The House and Senate are receiving a lot of mail, particularly those Members of the House and Senate from the States where the men came from that were in the Philippines at the time the Japs got the Philippines.
Sentence 42: [5.]
Sentence 43: Q. How about the Big Three meeting ?
Sentence 44: Has it moved along any?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 45: It is getting closer.
Sentence 46: It isn't yet definitely decided.
Sentence 47: But I think I can say definitely that it will take place in the not far distant future.
Sentence 48: [6.]

Sentence 71: The French have ceased firing as a result of the message which Mr. Churchill sent to De Gaulle, with the approval of the American Government.
Sentence 72: Q. Have we had any message from the French?
Sentence 73: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 74: None whatever.
Sentence 75: But the firing ceased, so I am reliably informed.
Sentence 76: Q. Sir, has the American Government also given approval to the proposal for a tripartite meeting in London, to discuss this Syrian question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 77: No.
Sentence 78: I have not--
Q. Sir, some rather informal responses were given to us yesterday at the State Department, indicating that we would be interested in such a meeting.

Sentence 81: Not to me, at any rate.
