Sentence 3: Gentlemen, I have but one announcement to make.
Sentence 4: I have come to the conclusion that it will be necessary to sign a continuing resolution so that some fifteen thousand Government employees can get paid--
Q.
Sentence 5: How many, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 6: Between 15,000 and 20,000.
Sentence 7: And I think that there will be no comment on that at the present time.
Sentence 8: I shall issue a statement at the time the resolution is signed, which will set out my position in the matter.
Sentence 9: That's all the announcements I have to make.
Sentence 10: [2.]
Sentence 11: Q. Mr. President, were you correctly quoted in regards to Senator Byrd the other day?

Sentence 14: [3.]
Sentence 15: Q. Mr. President, General Spaatz in the--retired, Air Force--in his column in Newsweek makes some very drastic and interesting suggestions about unification; and there are three or four suggestions, if you would allow me.
Sentence 16: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 17: Go right ahead.
Sentence 18: Q.
Sentence 19: He suggests abolishing the Secretaries of Army and Navy and Air Force, and taking their functions over into the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary; and to abolish the Joint Chiefs of Staff and create a general staff of the Armed Forces under a single chief, and make the commanders of the three services wholly responsible to the Secretary of Defense, and two or three other suggestions and recommendations.
Sentence 20: Are you aware of those--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 21: Yes, I am aware of them.
Sentence 22: Q. Have you anything to say about them?
Sentence 23: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 24: No, I have no comment to make on those recommendations.
Sentence 25: You see, all those things have been thoroughly and completely gone into time and again by me when we were first asking for the legislation.
Sentence 26: Several amendments now pending before the Armed Services Committee in which all the--at which time all those things will be thrashed out; and it isn't proper for me to make comment on that now, because the Congress is expecting to act on some amendments to the Unification Act.
Sentence 27: Q.
Sentence 28: I gather from what you said that you have seen the suggestions and have discussed them?
Sentence 29: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 30: Yes.
Sentence 31: Yes, I have.
Sentence 32: General Spaatz was a member of the Chiefs of Staff when all those matters were discussed, right here in this office.
Sentence 33: [4.]
Sentence 34: Q. There were reports published, I believe, that you had chastised Senator Lucas for not getting your program through the Senate?
Sentence 35: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 36: There isn't a word of truth in it.
Sentence 37: Q.
Sentence 38: You didn't scold him?
Sentence 39: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 40: No.
Q. Have you heard that--also the report that Senator Lucas intends to resign as majority leader?

Sentence 42: but I didn't believe it.
Sentence 43: [5.]
Sentence 44: Q. Mr. President, the President of Brazil, General Dutra, I believe, is coming May 18th, before your next press conference.
Sentence 45: I wonder if you would care to make any further comment as to the significance of his visit, or any special matters you might wish to discuss with him?
Sentence 46: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: There is no special comment that I can make except that I hope that the people of the United States will give the President of Brazil the same cordial welcome that the Brazilians gave me when I was down there; and I am sure they will.
Sentence 48: [6.]
Sentence 49: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us how your personal physician, Dr. Wallace Graham, feels about national health insurance?
Sentence 50: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 51: Huh?
Sentence 52: [Laughter] Why don't you ask Dr. Graham?
Sentence 53: You should know how he feels, or he wouldn't be in his job.
Sentence 54: [More laughter]
Sentence 55: [7.]
Sentence 56: Q. Mr. President, a Dr. William of Mississippi is quoted this morning as saying you have denied patronage to all of the Mississippi delegation in the House.

Sentence 59: That's the first I have heard about it.
Sentence 60: [8.]
Sentence 61: Q. Mr. President, a confidential report supposed to have been given to you by your Council of Economic Advisers leaked badly.

Sentence 63: It is a confidential report, just as you named it, and there is no comment on it.
Sentence 64: [9.]
Sentence 65: Q. Mr. President, some of the labor leaders seem to be in a mood for concessions.
Sentence 66: Are you?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 67: I hadn't talked to the labor leaders on that subject, and I therefore can't answer the question.
Sentence 68: My position has been well set out in the messages to the Congress, and it hasn't changed.
Sentence 69: Q. Mr. President, didn't Mr. Green and the other labor leaders discuss this with you?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 70: No.
Sentence 71: No, I didn't discuss the phase or any other.
Sentence 72: I discussed nearly everything else with them.
Sentence 73: [10.]
Sentence 74: Q. In spite of the fact that it is a confidential report, can you say whether the economic' report is optimistic or not?
Sentence 75: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 76: It wasn't pessimistic.
Sentence 77: Those reports are made to me confidentially once a month, and I get reports from the Federal Reserve Board, I get reports from the Department of Commerce, I get reports from the Department of Labor, I get reports from the Secretary of the Treasury, I get reports from Dun and Bradstreet, and from every other agency which will contribute to an understanding of just what the economic situation is.
Sentence 78: There isn't any reason in the world why those reports--confidential reports to should have leaked or should be made public, because it isn't necessary.
Sentence 79: Twice a year I make public the economic condition of the country in messages which I send to the Congress.

1
and called you by name.
Sentence 88: [Laughter]

For Secretary Acheson's remarks at his news conference on May 11, see the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 20, p. 660).
Sentence 89: The United Nations was about to vote on a resolution relaxing a 1946 resolution against the sending of ambassadors to Spain by permitting each nation to exercise its own judgment in the matter.
Sentence 90: In announcing that the United States would abstain from voting, Secretary Acheson stated that "the policy of the American Government is one which I am quite sure is calculated to please neither group of extremists in the United States--either those who say that we must embrace Franco, or those who say that we must cast him into the outermost darkness."
Sentence 91: [13.]
Sentence 92: Q. Mr. President, did the matter or question about your feelings regarding your recommendations on taxes and other matters include your request to the Congress in your State of the Union Message for economic controls?

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 94: That message still stands until I send another one on another line to the Congress.
Sentence 95: [14.]
Sentence 96: Q. Mr. President, could you tell us anything about the circumstances of Jonathan Daniel's inability to take the Navy job?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 97: I think the best way to find that out would be to ask Mr. Daniels.
Sentence 98: [15.]
Sentence 99: Q. Mr. President, are you thinking in terms of a purge about your opponents-about the opponents to your program on the Hill?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: I am not interested in a purge.
Sentence 101: The people will take care of that.
Sentence 102: [16.]

2
but I can't--

Sentence 122: Q. Mr. President, Chairman Doughton of the House Ways and Means Committee, after seeing you yesterday, said that he hoped higher taxes could be avoided.
Sentence 123: He also hoped that deficit financing could be avoided, but he was most enthusiastic in behalf of what he called rigid Government economies, in other words, he said, reducing appropriations from their present figure.
Sentence 124: I wonder how that squared with your policies?
Sentence 125: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 126: The rigid economy part we are in complete agreement on, and I exercised the most rigid economy when I sent the budget to the Congress.
Sentence 127: I always do that, and shall continue to do that.
Sentence 128: The topic of conversation between Mr. Doughton and myself was the Social Security Act, and we are in agreement on the approach to that.
Sentence 129: That is what he came to see me about.
Sentence 130: Q. Mr. President, just to clarify my thinking, sir, you still think there should be additional taxes, better than a deficit?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 131: There should be no deficit in Government financing in a country that has got a national income somewhere in the neighborhood of $217 billion.
Sentence 132: Q. Mr. President, do you feel that you can avoid a deficit without additional taxes?
Sentence 133: THE PRESIDENT, I do not.
Sentence 134: Q.
Sentence 135: What does the deficit now look like by the end of this fiscal year?
Sentence 136: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 137: I can't answer intelligently because I haven't the latest figures on it.
Sentence 138: They are getting them up now.
Sentence 139: I have to wait until I hear from the Treasury on the income for this last quarter.
Sentence 140: Q. Are you still thinking in terms of 4 billion?
Sentence 141: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 142: No, I never did think in terms of $4 billion.
Sentence 143: Q. New taxes.
Sentence 144: Q. I mean taxes.
Sentence 145: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 146: Oh.
Sentence 147: We will work that out when we see what the shortage is likely to be.
Sentence 148: Q.
Sentence 149: You mean it might be more?
Sentence 150: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 151: I can't tell.
Sentence 152: No, not more than 4 billion.
Sentence 153: Q. Could it be less, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 154: It will undoubtedly be less--much less.
Sentence 155: Q.
Sentence 156: This is that 600 or 700 million, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 157: That was the estimate at the beginning of the year.
Sentence 158: As I tell you, I can't give you an intelligent estimate until after the Treasury collects the figures.
Sentence 159: Q. Mr. President, I was running a question behind there.
Sentence 160: You said that you think undoubtedly it might well be considerably less than 4 billion in new taxes?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 161: No, I didn't say that.
Sentence 162: I said I thought the deficit would be much less than 4 billion.
Sentence 163: Q.
Sentence 164: To clarify that a little further, Mr. President, do you anticipate any change in the recommendations that you previously made for 4 billion in taxes?
Sentence 165: THE PRESIDENT, I do not.
Sentence 166: Q. Mr. President, can you explain why the class of people who were most worried about a deficit a year ago are less worried about it now?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 167: Well, I can't explain it now.
Sentence 168: It is a very interesting study in psychology, I think.
Sentence 169: Maybe some of you experts on that subject could go to work and write me an article.
Sentence 170: Q. Mr. President, how much surplus do you think there should be for debt retirement?
Sentence 171: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 172: I think we ought to retire some $2 to $5 billion on the debt every year.
Sentence 173: Q.
Sentence 174: You said 2 to 5, sir?
Sentence 175: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 176: 2 to 5 billion; that is, I did when I had the means to do it with.
Sentence 177: I retired more debt than any other President in the history of the United States.
Sentence 178: Q. How much have you retired, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 179: About 26 billion.
Sentence 180: That was more than the national debt after the First World War.
Sentence 181: Q. How much?
Sentence 182: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 183: About 26 billion.
Sentence 184: Reporter:
Sentence 185: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 186: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 187: You're welcome.
