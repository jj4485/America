Sentence 10: Beg your pardon?
Sentence 11: Q.
Sentence 12: Can you tell us about your plans to reorganize the Government under the Reorganization Act?

Sentence 18: Do you think that the loan should be set aside for immediate action on that?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 19: No.
Sentence 20: I think the loan is just as important as that.
Sentence 21: Q. Mr. President, they advance as an argument for passage of the loan, that failure to do so would push Great Britain closer to Russia ?

Sentence 24: [5.]
Sentence 25: Q. Mr. President, yesterday on the floor--day before yesterday, on the floor of the Senate, Senator Morse said that he didn't figure that you had used the full powers of your great office in the settlement of this coal strike.
Sentence 26: Do you feel that you have?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 27: Yes, I have, and I will continue to use them.
Sentence 28: Q. Mr. President, do you feel that you have any authority which might bring this coal strike to an end, without the acquiescence of John L. Lewis ?

Sentence 30: I haven't gone into that thoroughly yet.
Sentence 31: We are making that survey now.
Sentence 32: Q.
Sentence 33: In that connection--in connection with the question asked a moment ago, Mr. Lucas has a resolution which I think he is introducing today or tomorrow which would increase your authority.
Sentence 34: I noticed that administration leadership in the Senate is opposing it.
Sentence 35: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 46: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 47: It is slowly and gradually approaching that stage.
Sentence 48: Q. Mr. President, would you approve any union collecting a royalty on production?

Sentence 52: Q. Mr. President, the Wage Stabilization Board, I believe, has approved a payroll tax in the case of electrical workers, to be paid by the Association of Manufacturers to the union.
Sentence 53: That is the principle of the welfare fund, and does not--
THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 68: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 69: I am hoping they will get together.
Sentence 70: Q.
Sentence 71: Do you think that a strike would endanger the future success of the Railway Labor Act, in view of the fact that the unions have rejected fact-finding?
Sentence 72: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 74: Let's wait a while and see if it doesn't work out.
Sentence 75: [10.]

Sentence 82: Q. Mr. President, in connection with the coal strike again, this week you appointed an investigation board in connection with the airplane strike.

Sentence 84: Is there any particular reason why those--there isn't any
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 85: The law provides for the appointment of one in the airplane strike, and there is no law providing for one in the coal strike.

THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 98: Have you any comment on that?
Sentence 99: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 100: I haven't seen the letter.
Sentence 101: [14.]
Sentence 102: Q. Mr. President, returning for a moment to this situation on the Hill, with regard to the coal strike, this Lucas resolution provides that if you seize--it gives you authority to seize the mines, or any plant where you would regard the public interest at stake, and provides that if you do that, that any worker who did not follow your request to go back to work would lose all seniority recognition under the Wagner Act, and that any labor leaders who did not ask their men to go back to work in good faith, would be in violation of the law and be subject to fine or imprisonment.
Sentence 103: I wonder if you would favor something of that sort?

Sentence 146: [Laughter]
Sentence 147: [20.]
Sentence 148: Q. Mr. President, instead of just giving us answers to our questions, can't you kind of "lay out" the coal strike picture as you see it today, just so that we will understand exactly what your position is on this.--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 149: I would rather not discuss it today.
Sentence 150: I will discuss it at a later date for you.
