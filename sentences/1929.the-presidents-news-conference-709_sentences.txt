Sentence 1: 1929 The Presidents News Conference 709

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I haven't anything to state for quotation or publication today.
Sentence 3: REVIEW OR THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT
I have inquiries on one subject, that is, the discussions between myself and the Army staff and the War Department officials about the study there.
Sentence 4: I can't add anything to the public statement I have made already.
Sentence 5: For your own information, we spent a great many hours in discussing the details of that study to be undertaken in complete review of the establishment in light of the situation today, with the purpose of studying every possible avenue of economy.
Sentence 6: When these studies are complete from the various branches of the staff, they will be reviewed by a board to be set up within the staff, and thereby, I have placed on the Army itself the first responsibility of this inquiry; and I haven't any doubt that they will cooperate with the Executive in an endeavor to meet the public need of an adequate preparedness at the least possible cost.
Sentence 7: I know the very high character of the men in the staff and in the Army, and I know they are going to take advantage of this opportunity to make a complete review of their setup, and they welcome the chance to do it.
Sentence 8: So that is about all I have.
Sentence 9: Q.
Sentence 10: Can we have copies of that, Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 11: Yes, for background; not a matter of public interest particularly any more until we have the studies made.
