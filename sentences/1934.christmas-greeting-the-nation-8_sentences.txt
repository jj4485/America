This is the second year that I have joined with you on this happy occasion.
Sentence 2: Then, as now, with millions of others we celebrate the happy observance of Christmas.

Sentence 4: We have seen fulfilled many things that a year ago were only hopes.

Sentence 6: This year again we are entitled to new hopes and new anticipations.
Sentence 7: For all those who can hear but not see this gathering, let me explain that here before us in the park in front of the White House is the monument of a man who will live forever as the embodiment of courageâ€”Andrew Jackson.
Sentence 8: His was a long, long life in the public service, distinguished at all times by a chivalrous meeting of problems and difficulties that attended that service, a fast belief in people and a profound love for them.
Sentence 9: His patriotism was unstained and unafraid.
Sentence 10: Carved into that monument is his expression of the necessity for union.
Sentence 11: That message grows in importance with the years.
Sentence 12: In these days it means to me a union not only of the States but a union of the hearts and minds of the people in all the States and their many interests and purposes, devoted with unity to the human welfare of our country.
