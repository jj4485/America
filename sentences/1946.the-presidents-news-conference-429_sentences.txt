Sentence 1: 1946 The Presidents News Conference 429

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have no announcements to make this morning, so I suppose it will be a question-and-answer program.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: Q. Mr. President, are there any plans for the international trial of Nazi industrialists at the termination of the present trial ?
Sentence 5: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 6: They are working on the plans.
Sentence 7: Q. Will that be for an international trial--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 8: I can't answer that now.
Sentence 9: I have no comment to make on that.

Sentence 11: [2.]
Sentence 12: Q. Mr. President, at your budget seminar recently, you said you spoke to someone who had been making public statements that taxes could be reduced 20 percent in 1947; and Congressman Knutson having made so many statements was supposed to be the man you referred to--has asked you to clear up that question.
Sentence 13: Can you tell us who you did talk to?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 14: I will say this to you, that that is one time I made an error.
Sentence 15: I was completely surprised when I saw Mr. Knutson's letter in the press.
Sentence 16: It was published before it reached me, therefore it was not necessary to answer it; but that was a mistake entirely--and the President makes them as well as anybody else.
Sentence 17: I would like Mr. Knutson to tell me, however, how he could make that 20 percent cut.
Sentence 18: Q. Did you speak with Knutson, sir?
Sentence 19: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 20: Yes.
Sentence 21: I had been discussing the matter with three or four people previous to that, and it was just an error on my part, that was.

Sentence 23: Q. Mr. President, on this Mead committee report on Canol, is it not true that no member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, past or present, divulged what went on in the meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, unless the President directs such disclosure?
Sentence 24: Specifically, about Admiral King?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 25: That has been customary, of course, but the Canol project is a dead horse--was completely investigated and the report was made on it when I was chairman of that committee.
Sentence 26: Those investigations and reports were made for the purpose of preventing the digging up of dead horses.
Sentence 27: It doesn't do any good to dig them up any more.
Sentence 28: It has been decided to dispose of it.

Sentence 58: Has that come to you, that suggestion ?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 59: No.
Sentence 60: No, that's the first time I have had that suggestion.
Sentence 61: I think these Congressmen are entitled to a campaign from now until election time, without interruption.

Sentence 74: Remember that adroit question that was asked me at my news conference?
Sentence 75: [Laughter]

Sentence 88: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 89: I didn't understand that?
Sentence 90: Q. That Secretary Schwellenbach had said that he thinks the labor delegates to the ILO should be alternated between the CIO and the A.F. of L. ?
