Sentence 1: 1948 The Presidents News Conference 367

THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 2: I have no statements for you today, but I will try my best to answer questions, if you have any.
Sentence 3: [1.]
Sentence 4: Q. Mr. President, have you any observations to make on the record of the special session?
Sentence 5: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 6: Well, my observations are that it was a kind of a poor result that we got.
Sentence 7: 1
I think more action could very well have been taken.
Sentence 8: There were instances when committees refused even to meet to hear the administration's views on the subjects on which we asked them to act.
Sentence 9: On those things that they did act upon, it didn't take them very long.
Sentence 10: I think it took 40 minutes to pass the appropriation for the-authorization for the United Nations loan; and it didn't take them very long to take the emasculated housing bill out, when they wanted to act.
Sentence 11: And the educational bill, and the Taft--Ellender-Wagner bill--the housing bill that I asked for--were both in the same shape as the U.N. loan was.
Sentence 12: And I think they could have taken a great many more actions, very easily, and in just as short a time, if they had been so inclined.
Sentence 13: 1
On August 12 the White House released a summary of action taken by the special session in response to the measures proposed by the President in his message of July 27 (see note to Item 165).
Sentence 14: Q. Would you say it was a "do-nothing" session, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 15: I would say it was entirely a "do-nothing" session.
Sentence 16: I think that's a good name for the 80th Congress.
Sentence 17: Q. Mr. President, will you hold Governor Dewey responsible for the record of the 80th Congress in the campaign?
Sentence 18: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 19: I have no comment on that.
Sentence 20: [2.]
Sentence 21: Q. Mr. President, Congressman Mundt, commenting on your statement that the red investigation was nothing but a "red herring,"
1
told a radio audience that he believed that the committee's work will make you eat your statement word by word.
Sentence 22: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 23: General Eisenhower didn't think so.
Sentence 24: General Eisenhower didn't think so.
Sentence 25: 1
See Item 170 [4].
Sentence 26: Q.
Sentence 27: You still think it's a "red herring," sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 28: Yes, I do.
Sentence 29: The first--the strongest type you can smell.
Sentence 30: [3.]
Sentence 31: Q. Can you tell us, sir, when Selective Service inductions will begin?
Sentence 32: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 33: No, I haven't been informed yet.
Sentence 34: The machinery hasn't been completely set up.
Sentence 35: I will let you know whenever the time is ready.
Sentence 36: Q. Mr. President, you are considering permitting women to serve on draft boards, in some cases, as has been suggested?
Sentence 37: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: I haven't given it any consideration.
Sentence 39: There is no reason why they shouldn't.
Sentence 40: [4.]
Sentence 41: Q. Mr. President, recently, the Immigration Service ordered the deportation of 24 nationals of Baltic countries who landed in Boston last month.
Sentence 42: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 43: You are mistaken about that.
Sentence 44: They haven't been ordered to be deported, and every effort is being made to treat them just like those that landed down in Florida.
Sentence 45: 1
This is different from the one in Florida.
Sentence 46: And Congressman Kennedy of Boston introduced a bill to allow these people to stay.
Sentence 47: Of course, the Congress didn't get to act on it.
Sentence 48: The Attorney General and the Immigration Service are doing everything they possibly can to keep these people in the country.
Sentence 49: 1
See 1946 volume, this series, Items 239 and 246.
Sentence 50: Q.
Sentence 51: The problem is whether they will be allowed to stay in this country?
Sentence 52: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: Well, I can't answer that until we have all the facts.
Sentence 54: But there is no order of deportation being asked, and there won't be one in the immediate future.
Sentence 55: [5.]
Sentence 56: Q. Mr. President, can you tell us about your conference tonight with political leaders ?

Sentence 78: Q. Other than this cruise on the Potomac, do you plan anything?
Sentence 79: THE PRESIDENT.

Sentence 90: Do you have any comment on that, or is there any?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 91: No.
Sentence 92: There is absolutely nothing to it.
Sentence 93: That increase was brought about, I think you will find, due to the European recovery program, and also I know of no appointments on that setup except those necessitated by Mr. Hoffman.

Sentence 116: I hope Mr. Taft is a good prophet.
Sentence 117: I don't agree with him.
Sentence 118: Q. Do you think prices will level off soon then?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 119: Well, let's wait and see.

Sentence 135: But it will take some time for that to take effect.
Sentence 136: You see, these crops aren't even gathered yet, except the wheat crop.
Sentence 137: The corn crop is yet to be gathered, and it will be some time before we will know what effect that will have on the situation.
Sentence 138: Q. Mr. President, what is the answer to those who say it is not consistent to have a program to support prices, and a program to reduce or control them?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 139: I don't know what their system of philosophy is.
Sentence 140: It isn't mine, you can rest assured on that.
