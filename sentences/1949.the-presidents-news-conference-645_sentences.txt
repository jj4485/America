Sentence 207: I think Mr. Ross answered that question fully and completely this morning.
Sentence 208: 7
You will have to put up with that answer.
Sentence 209: 7
During the morning, Charles G. Ross, Secretary to the President, dictated the following statement to the press:
"Any attribution to the President of any plan to intervene in the coal and steel strikes or to fix a deadline on the effort to reach a settlement through mediation is entirely without warrant.
Sentence 210: "This office has told you every day, in reply to questions, the literal and exact truth of the situation.
Sentence 211: "Obviously this office cannot foreclose the possibility of appropriate action by the President on any matter before him at any time.
Sentence 212: "He 'may' do anything that is within his power to do.
Sentence 213: But it is literally true that the strikes are in the hands of the Mediation Service at this time and the President is keeping hands off.
Sentence 214: "He certainly is not putting out statements, directly or indirectly, that he is going to intervene.
Sentence 215: "
Mr. Ross went on to state that he was authorized by the President to say that he had not discussed the present strike situation with any member of the Cabinet.
Sentence 216: Upon being questioned by a reporter, Mr. Ross conceded that the President might have mentioned the subject in a Cabinet meeting.
Sentence 217: Q.
Sentence 218: What was the question?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 219: He wanted to know if I was embarrassed by the purported interview by the Cabinet officer, and I told him Mr. Ross had answered that question thoroughly and completely this morning just the way I wanted it answered.
Sentence 220: [17.]
Sentence 221: Q. Mr. President, have you got anybody yet for the Economic Council?
Sentence 222: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 223: No, not yet.
Sentence 224: I will announce it just as quickly as I find a man to take the job.
Sentence 225: [18.]
Sentence 226: Q. Going back to the Navy situation, does this correspondence make clear when you made the decision on it, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 227: I answered the letter of the Secretary of the Navy, and that is when the decision was made.
Q.
Sentence 228: The dates show?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 229: Yes.
Sentence 230: Q. Mr. President, do you expect other changes in the Navy, following--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 231: Well, I do not know what the procedure will be from now on.
Sentence 232: Q. Mr. President, you said you hadn't talked to anyone except the Secretary of the Navy about it.
Sentence 233: What about the Secretary of Defense, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 234: The Secretary of Defense was present when I talked to the Secretary of the Navy.
Sentence 235: He heard the conversation.
Sentence 236: Q.
Sentence 237: That would have been the day before yesterday then, wouldn't it, sir?
Sentence 238: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 239: It could have been.
Sentence 240: [Laughter]
Q. Mr. President, did you talk to the Navy Secretary today?
Sentence 241: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 242: Yes, I did.
Sentence 243: Q.
Sentence 244: In the case of the other officers except Admiral Denfeld, the Secretary of the Navy can act on his own, can't he, sir?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 245: I think so.
Sentence 246: I think that that is true.
Sentence 247: Reporter:
Sentence 248: Thank you, Mr. President.
Sentence 249: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 250: You're entirely welcome.
