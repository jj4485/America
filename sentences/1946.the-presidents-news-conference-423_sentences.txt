Sentence 4: We now anticipate net receipts for 1946--the fiscal year 1946 of 42,900 million, which is about 4,300 million above the January estimate.
Sentence 5: And it is now estimated that the budget will amount to about 64,700 million, which is about 2 billion, six below the January estimate.
Sentence 6: I have this thing all mimeographed, with the details and everything, so you can work it out to suit yourselves.
Sentence 7: That will mean an anticipated net deficit now of 21,722 million, against the former anticipated deficit of 28,620 million.
Sentence 8: It's a difference of 6,898 million-closer to 7 billion.
Sentence 9: Better off than we thought we were going to be.

Sentence 27: Q. Mr. Brandt: Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Sentence 28: [The President gave him the telegram.]
Sentence 29: I helped--I thank you for an assist on that.
Sentence 30: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 31: All right, Pete.
Sentence 32: I was afraid I was going to get into trouble with all the rest of these people.
Sentence 33: It got results, anyway.
Sentence 34: Q.
Sentence 35: [Woman reporter:]
Sentence 36: Would you like to discuss nylon stockings?
Sentence 37: [Laughter]
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 38: I might--I am afraid I had better not take on nylon stockings.

Sentence 40: [More laughter]
Sentence 41: Any questions now?
Sentence 42: [3.]
Sentence 43: Q. Mr. President, do you support Lewis Douglas for president of the World Bank?
Sentence 44: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 45: Yes.
Sentence 46: Q.
Sentence 47: And if so, what is your reaction to Mr. Morgenthau's letter of opposition?

Sentence 49: [4.]
Sentence 50: Q. Mr. President, Harold Ickes-whom you may recall--[laughter]--says that he advised you twice last October to smash John L. Lewis.
Sentence 51: He didn't say just how.
Sentence 52: I was wondering if you intend to follow his advice?
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 53: You saw the comment on Mr. Ickes, did you not, in the Daily News, on that same subject?
Sentence 54: I would advise you to read the editorial.
Sentence 55: Q.
Sentence 56: I would rather have your comment.
Sentence 57: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 58: I have no comment to make on Mr. Ickes whatever.
Sentence 59: [5.]
Sentence 60: Q. Mr. President, in your Chicago press conference, there was something mentioned about the poll tax.
Sentence 61: Can that be taken to mean that States alone have the power to repeal--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 62: I anticipated that you would ask me that question, and I have got a statement prepared for you which will be the answer to you.
Sentence 63: I will read it for you.
Sentence 64: [Reading, not literally] "I haven't changed my position on Federal anti-poll tax legislation.
Sentence 65: I am still in favor of Federal legislation.
Sentence 66: I voted for cloture on this issue in the Senate, and I would do so again if I were a Senator.
Sentence 67: "However, I also favor State action.
Sentence 68: There is no contradiction between Federal and State action on this matter.
Sentence 69: While the Federal anti-poll tax legislation has been pending in the Congress, several States have abandoned the poll tax.
Sentence 70: "
And you must have the support of the people for any law.
Sentence 71: The prohibition law proved that.
Sentence 72: [Continuing reading, not literally] "This is a great step forward, and I hope more States will see fit to change their poll tax laws.
Sentence 73: "It may well be that the possibility of Federal action has stimulated State action.
Sentence 74: This is often the case with State and local legislation.
Sentence 75: For example, while we were pressing for the Federal action on fair employment practice legislation, several States and a number of municipalities have adopted fair employment practice acts.
Sentence 76: Federal legislation and State legislation should supplement one another wherever possible.
Sentence 77: I am in favor of both Federal and State action on anti-poll tax legislation, FEPC and all similar legislation.
Sentence 78: "
That ought to clear the matter up completely.
Sentence 79: [6.]
Sentence 80: Q. Mr. President, at the eve of the--your first year as President of the United States, I was wondering if you would care to make a personal appraisal of the past year?
Sentence 81: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 82: I don't think it is necessary.
Sentence 83: There have been enough appraisals made for the President.
Sentence 84: [Laughter] I would advise you just to read them, and take your choice.
Sentence 85: That is what I have been doing.
Sentence 86: Q. How do you feel about your physical--
THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 87: I feel just as well physically as I did at the beginning of it; in fact, a little bit better, if anything.
Sentence 88: Q. Which appraisal did you choose?
Sentence 89: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 90: I haven't made a choice yet, because they don't seem to be through yet.
Sentence 91: [Laughter] I don't want to play any favorites.
Sentence 92: [7.]
Sentence 93: Q. Mr. President, whom does Luther Johnson succeed on that Tax Court?

Sentence 100: He will leave for China at once.
Sentence 101: Q.
Sentence 102: Can you tell us anything about what he wanted them--he spoke a great deal about economic and material assistance to China, to the press?
Sentence 103: THE PRESIDENT.
Sentence 104: I think at the proper time all those matters will be released.
Sentence 105: It is a little bit early now to make a release because it might embarrass General .Marshall.
Sentence 106: Let's wait till he gets back to China and authorizes the release, and the whole thing will be turned loose for the benefit of everybody, just as the policy will be turned loose, at the proper time, for China.
Sentence 107: [9.]
