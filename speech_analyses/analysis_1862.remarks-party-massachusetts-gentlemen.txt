This speech references America indirectly by discussing the social and political situations of the time. The speaker refers to Massachusetts, one of the states in America, and praises the quality of its local craftsmanship. The reference to "whipping rebels" presumably refers to the American Civil War, which began in 1861 and in which Massachusetts played a key role as a Union state. There are also mentions of whipping negroes which could likely indicate the contentious issue of slavery prevalent in that era in America. Furthermore, the speaker expresses hope for peaceful future days, driving through a 'happy and prosperous' land, which can be inferred as the vision for America.
