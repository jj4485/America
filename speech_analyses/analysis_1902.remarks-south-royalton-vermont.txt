The speaker celebrates the contributions of the Civil War veterans, embodying the American value of military service, bravery and sacrifice for the nation. It also highlights the importance of educating the younger generation, reflecting on the American principle of prioritizing education for all.

The speaker further underscores the civic duties of American citizens in peace times. The statement about people doing well in peace as a precursor to doing well in war implies the speaker's understanding of the American citizens' responsibilities not only in times of conflict but also during peace, signifying the American ideal of good citizenship.
