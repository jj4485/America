The speech references America in several ways:

1. America's Economic Status: It details the significant improvement in the country's financial situation. The speaker notes that at a previous time, there was great anxiety regarding the country's currency and credit, and treasury receipts were insufficient to meet the country's obligations. However, this has changed, and the country currently has a surplus instead of a deficit.

2. America's Productivity: The speech also emphasizes the existing state of productivity in the country's manufacturing, mining, agricultural, and mercantile industries.

3. America's International Relations: It highlights the importance of promoting reciprocal trade arrangements with other nations and maintains an emphasis on peaceful settlement of disputes with other powers.

4. America's Stance on Liberty: It underscores America's principle of securing and extending freedoms, not just within its borders but also to others.

5. America's Governance: The speech emphasizes the necessity of honesty and diligence in the public sector, highlights the role of the Executive and Congress, and discusses duty to the constitution.

6. America's Military Actions: It refers to a war fought honorably by American forces and highlights the country's role in the events in China.

7. American Patriots: The speaker talks about the strong hearts and helpful hands found all across the country and acknowledges America's reunification and the disappearance of sectionalism.

8. America's Responsibilities: Finally, it details the responsibilities America has assumed – specifically with regard to Cuba’s independence and the governance of the Philippine Islands.
This speech references America in a number of ways. Firstly, it mentions the United States military's mission of emancipation, which represents one of America's values - freedom. It talks about the country's offer of amnesty to insurgents, demonstrating America's approach to conflict resolution. 

The speech also raises the issue of the war not being against the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands but against a portion of them who have raised arms against the Government, thus depicting America as a victim rather than an aggressor. 

Furthermore, the American values of security for life, property, liberty, freedom of conscience, and the pursuit of happiness are highlighted as what the "loyal millions" in the islands stand to gain from recognizing American sovereignty. 

The speech asserts America's commitment to protecting these loyal citizens and its unwillingness to abandon them, reflecting the country's sense of duty and care. 

Lastly, the mention of an eventual transition to "order under civil institutions" once those who resist America's rule cease hostilities, portrays America's belief in civil governance and peace.
