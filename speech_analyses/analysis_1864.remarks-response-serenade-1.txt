The speech refers to America in several ways. First, it addresses the audience as "fellow-citizens", which implies they are all part of the American nation. The speaker mentions the "loyal citizens of Pennsylvania," which is a state in the United States, as the ones who have paid him a compliment. 

Additionally, the speech often refers to the "nation", "country," and "Union organization." These terms are an indirect reference to the United States. The Union Organization likely refers to the Union side during the American Civil War, which was ongoing at the time the speech was delivered. 

The speaker also discusses the election, which is a fundamental part of the American democratic system. Furthermore, he mentions the "rights of humanity," which reflects American values and principles. 

Lastly, the person giving the speech is the part of the "present Administration," implying he is a leader, perhaps even the President, of the American government.
