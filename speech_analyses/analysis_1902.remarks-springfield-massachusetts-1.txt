This speech references America in several ways, chiefly focusing on its military endeavors and the valor of its soldiers. The speech starts with a fond acknowledgment of fellow Americans including the Massachusetts regiment with whom the speaker served at Santiago. 

America is further referenced through the discussion of its soldiers who fought in Cuba and the Philippines, all portrayed as brave 'brothers, sons, and neighbors' who had to endure treacherous terrain and foes. The speaker defends these men, comparing the occasional wrongs committed by them in the heat of battle to the daily wrongs committed at home in America's cities.

Regarding expansion, the speaker remarks on the historical expansion of America from the frontier town of Northfield, Massachusetts to encompassing much more territory. They also discuss the country's unexpected territorial acquisition of the Philippines as a part of America's 'destiny', justifying this by drawing parallels with the expansion in Northfield's history.

Overall, the speech portrays America as a country of brave soldiers, willing to expand and adjust to new circumstances while highlighting the need for understanding and judging its people leniently.
