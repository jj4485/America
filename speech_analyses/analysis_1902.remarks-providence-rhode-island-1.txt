This speech references America by discussing its socio-economic conditions at the time, including periods of commercial prosperity, the rise of industrial development, and the emergence of great private and corporate fortunes. It discusses some of the challenges facing the country, such as the effects of urbanization, income inequality, and the complexity of managing emerging business mechanisms. It also highlights the American governance system, including the dichotomy between state and federal power, particularly when it comes to regulation of corporations and trusts. In so doing, it suggests necessary actions to improve these conditions, such as the U.S. government assuming more jurisdiction over corporations conducting interstate business, better laws, and the importance of prudence and self-restraint in both individuals and government. The speaker also references America's history and its potential future trajectory.
The speech does not explicitly reference America, but it discusses several themes often associated with American values and the American way of life. For instance, it encourages transparency, justice, and orderly liberty as fundamental principles for any great nation, which aligns with the ideals upon which the United States is built. It also emphasizes the power of individual initiative and qualities such as hard work, keen intelligence, and unflinching will, which mirror the self-reliant and entrepreneurial spirit often associated with the American Dream. The reference to achieving national greatness and true civilization and freedom can also relate to America's pursuit of these goals. 

The speaker's mention of "the trust question" and the enforcement of existing laws "without regard to persons" could potentially point to America's struggle with monopolies, trusts, and the importance of law enforcement impartiality, issues that have historically been significant in the US.

In overall context, while the speech doesn't directly reference America, its principles and the issues addressed in it could easily relate to America and its values.
