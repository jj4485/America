This speech references America by discussing the critical issues facing the nation during the time of the Civil War. The speaker, assumed to be President Abraham Lincoln, expresses his concern for the nation's welfare and underscores his commitment towards its unification. The excerpt also references America's struggles with the institution of slavery and its impact on the war. Furthermore, "America" is symbolized by the "great country" or the "Union", demonstrating the President's focus on unity and the ultimate success of the nation against the rebellion. The speech also mentions the Democratic party, which is part of the American political landscape, and their strategies which the speaker disagrees with. Concepts such as the democratic electoral process (November elections), military strategies (emancipation policy), and an indication of the societal makeup of the nation (men from Northern and Southern states, free men, and slaves) paint a picture of America during that historical period.
