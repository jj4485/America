This speech references America by its mention of the nation and the key ideals of free government and free institutions, which are integral aspects of American identity. It emphasizes the reliance on the people of the country, their bravery and strength, in upholding these freedoms. It also references America's challenges ("the difficulties which have surrounded the nation") presumably in the context of the Civil War as it took place in 1862. The speaker also invokes a sense of unity and gratitude towards the soldiers, particular to the 12th Indiana Regiment, on behalf of the nation. This positions America as a country appreciative of its military forces.
