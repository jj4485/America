This speech references America indirectly through the context of events and figures that are part of American history. The mention of elections suggests the democratic electoral process prevalent in the U.S., reflecting the American political system. The reference to General Sherman hints at the civil war era (Sherman was a prominent Union General during the American Civil War in the 1860s). Additionally, the call for cheers for General Sherman and the army suggest an appeal to American patriotism and respect for its military forces. However, the speech does not explicitly mention America or any specific characteristics or symbols typically used to represent the country. It only provides context that can be associated with America.
