The speech references America in the context of upholding law and order, valuing the concept of 'liberty under the law' as opposed to lawlessness. The speaker emphasizes the responsibility and role of the people in enforcing and observing the laws of the land, suggesting that it's their sanity, cool-headedness and self-restraint that makes a country successful. There's also mention of treating every American citizen as equals, irrespective of their wealth, symbolized by the phrase "that the rich man and the poor man are held to an equal accountability before it".

America is also referred to in terms of the nation's aspirations and ideals. The speaker admires Vermont's ability to work towards these ideals, contributing more than its share to national leadership and setting an exemplary model for the rest of the nation.

Apart from this, the speaker refers to Senator Morrill, a prominent representative from Vermont, noting his modest lifestyle despite his significant contribution to the nation. He uses this as an example to emphasize his point that wealth should neither be a measure of a person's value nor a reason for judgment, and this principle is asserted as one that Vermont largely adheres to, and one which is integral to America's spirit and success.
