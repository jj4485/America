This speech seems to reference a significant period in American history. The year 1868 and the mention of uniforms suggest it may be referring to the aftermath of the Civil War, which ended in 1865, three years prior to the time of the speech. This would coincide with the speaker's comment about uniforms being laid off three years ago. The call to lay off the uniforms again and the promise of peace could be interpreted as a call for unity and healing within the nation after the war. Therefore, while the excerpt does not explicitly reference America, this context indirectly refers to significant American events and sentiments.
