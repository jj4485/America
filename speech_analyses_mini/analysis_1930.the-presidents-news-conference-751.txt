In the excerpt from the president's news conference in 1930, while there is no direct reference to America, the context suggests several points about the country at that time. 

1. **Leadership and Communication**: The president’s admission that he lacks news reflects on the relationship between leadership and the public. It indicates that even the highest office is not always privy to the latest information, highlighting a potential sense of disconnect in communication during that era.

2. **Public Awareness**: The statement acknowledges that the citizens might be more informed about current events than their elected leader, suggesting an engaged or active public. This can be interpreted as a reflection on American society and its relationship with democracy and the news.

3. **Historical Context**: The speech took place during the Great Depression, a time of economic turmoil in America. The lack of news could imply uncertainty and a struggle for effective communication during challenging times.

Overall, while the speech does not explicitly mention America, it implicitly reflects aspects of American political life, governance, and the socio-economic climate of the time.
