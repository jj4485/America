The excerpt from the speech references America indirectly through the discussion of key issues relevant to the nation at the time, specifically focusing on railway rates and the impact of the O'Fallon decision. The mention of "railway rates" pertains to a fundamental aspect of America's transportation and economic system, which was crucial in the context of the early 20th century, especially in a nation that relied heavily on railroads for commerce and movement of goods and people.

Additionally, the reference to the "Law Enforcement Commission" suggests a governmental effort to address public safety and law enforcement, which are important aspects of governance and society in America. The President's assurance that there would be no increase in railway rates reflects an economic concern that touches on the welfare of American consumers and the stability of the transportation industry.

Overall, while the word "America" is not explicitly mentioned, the themes of transportation, economic policy, and government oversight in the speech are deeply connected to the broader context of American society and its challenges during that period.
