The speech excerpt references America primarily through its focus on the establishment of the Veterans' Administration, which is an entity created to serve the needs of American veterans. The discussion of consolidating various veterans' agencies underlines the government's commitment to providing support and care for those who have served in the armed forces, reflecting a broader duty of the American government to its citizens, especially those who have sacrificed for their country.

Additionally, the emphasis on the significant budget allocation of about $800 million for veterans' services indicates the government's prioritization of veterans' affairs within the context of American values and responsibilities. The speaker, identified as the President, articulates this consolidation as one of the most important steps taken by the administration, which suggests a strategic approach to improving the functioning of government for the welfare of Americans, particularly veterans. 

Overall, the speech highlights a critical aspect of American governance—caring for veterans—and illustrates the government's role in addressing their needs through organizational efficiencies and budgetary commitments.
