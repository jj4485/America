1. **Federal Farm Board**: The mention of the Federal Farm Board highlights the government's initiative to support the agricultural sector, which is vital to the American economy. The establishment of this board reflects an effort to address the needs and challenges faced by American farmers, particularly in the context of the economic conditions of the late 1920s.

This highlights the importance of government funding in addressing national needs and reflects American values regarding investment in public works and infrastructure development.

4. **Public Works and Employment**: The plan for constructing multiple government buildings in a rotation system aims to save costs and create jobs through continuous construction activities. This approach not only addresses infrastructure needs but also points to the government's role in economic stimulation and job creation, which are significant themes in American economic policy.

5. **Bipartisanship and Legislative Process**: There is an acknowledgment that these plans require congressional authorization, indicating the democratic processes in place for significant government projects in America. It suggests a collaborative approach typical of American governance, where different branches work together to achieve common goals.
