The excerpt does not explicitly mention America, but it does indirectly reference its values, ideals, and the broader context of American identity and philosophy. Here are some points where America can be inferred:

1. **Universal Ideals**: The speech emphasizes the concepts of justice, right, and humanity, which resonate with American democratic values and ideals. The speaker implies a connection to American principles of equality, freedom, and the importance of individual thought, which align with ideas central to American identity.

2. **Role of Universities**: The mention of universities as places that weave a "human web" and the duty of universities to promote peace and understanding can reflect the role of American institutions in fostering democratic ideals and international cooperation. This suggests an alignment with the American perspective on education as a means to advance society and global ideals.

3. **Critique of Central Empires**: The speaker's lament about the misuse of science by the Central Empires during the war can be seen in contrast to American ideals, where science and knowledge are typically associated with progress and the betterment of humanity. This highlights a difference between the ideologies of the United States and those countries involved in the war.

4. **Call for Unity**: The overall message of seeking peace through shared thoughts and ideals can be viewed as an echo of America's post-war vision for international cooperation and unity among nations, which would later lead to the formation of organizations like the League of Nations and the United Nations.

In summary, while America is not explicitly referenced in the speech, its values and ideals are implicitly reflected in the themes of justice, universal knowledge, and the responsibility of education and science to uplift humanity.
