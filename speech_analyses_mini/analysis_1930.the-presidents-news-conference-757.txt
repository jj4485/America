In the excerpt of the speech, America is referenced primarily through the context of government expenditures and budget allocations, reflecting the financial situation of the country during that time. The President discusses the appropriations made by Congress and how they impact the federal budget, which is essential for governing the nation and implementing public works programs that can benefit the American populace.

Specifically, the mention of increased expenditures for projects like “rivers and harbors, public works, Boulder Dam, and veterans' relief” directly ties back to national interests and the welfare of American citizens. These are initiatives aimed at infrastructure improvement and support for veterans, highlighting the government’s responsibility to manage resources effectively for the benefit of the country.

The President’s emphasis on reviewing government agencies to impose economies indicates an awareness of the need to stabilize the financial situation of the nation, especially in response to economic downturns—suggesting a broader commitment to responsible fiscal management that would support American citizens during challenging times.

Moreover, the discussion of the political and geographical representation in the appointments of commissions connects to the diverse interests and regional dynamics within America, showcasing the complexity of governance in a diverse nation. Thus, while the speech is centered around budgetary matters, it implicitly reflects the administration's concerns for the American economy, infrastructure, and governance.
