The speech excerpt references America in several ways:

1. **Economic Context**: The discussion about the Tariff Commission and the appointments made, including experienced individuals, indicates a focus on American economic policy and trade regulation. This suggests that the U.S. government is actively managing its trade relationships and economic strategies during a period that likely involves concerns about the economy, particularly given the mention of the year 1930, which is during the Great Depression.

2. **Foreign Trade Data**: The President provides specific statistics on U.S. imports and exports, indicating how American trade is functioning in the global market. The fact that exports are exceeding imports by a significant amount (exports around $300 million, imports about $217 million) highlights the economic activity of America and its role in international trade. The reference to a percentage decrease in exports and imports compared to previous months also indicates the challenges faced by the American economy at the time.

3. **Economics and Policy**: The mention of foreign trade and the overall assessment of buying power illustrates the President's concern for the American economy's health. The analysis of how foreign trade has been affected by price drops and the distinction between dollar values and actual quantity shows a robust engagement with economic conditions that directly impact American businesses and consumers.

4. **Leadership and Governance**: By appointing key figures to the Tariff Commission and ensuring continuity in investigations and policies, the President is affirming a proactive leadership stance to address and guide America through economic challenges.

Overall, the speech provides insight into the economic state and policies of the United States during the early 1930s, with a particular focus on trade and the actions being taken to shape America's economic future.
