In the excerpt you provided, the speech references America in a few key ways:

1. **Navy Reductions**: The President addresses the concerns regarding the reduction of Navy personnel. He explains that the Navy operates under a system of enlistment where recruits serve for definite periods and that the Navy would not discharge personnel before their term ends. This reflects on America's military commitments and the governance of personnel within the armed forces, particularly in the context of post-war adjustments.

2. **Helium Exports**: The President discusses the U.S. government's policy on helium exports, indicating that private companies in America have been given licenses to export helium and have been encouraged to develop foreign markets. This highlights America's role in producing helium and its regulatory framework governing exports, thus connecting to America's economy and international trade policies.

3. **Economic Context**: The speech also reflects on the economic concerns of the time, particularly regarding unemployment. By asserting that the Navy's personnel reductions will occur naturally through normal processes (wastage), the President is attempting to reassure the public about the economic implications of military downsizing.

4. **Geographical Reference**: The mention of helium being produced primarily in the western United States places the context of production and export directly within American borders, signifying regional economic contributions and limitations.

Overall, the speech situates these topics within a framework relevant to American governance, military policy, economic conditions, and international trade practices during the early 20th century.
