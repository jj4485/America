In the excerpt from the speech, the President references America primarily in the context of military expenditures, defense preparedness, and international relations. Here are some key points of how America is referenced:

1. **Military Expenditures**: The President discusses the significant increase in military spending, highlighting that the military expenditure (combined Army and Navy) represents a substantial portion of the federal budget. He points out that, despite the current lack of immediate danger to peace, the military budget of the United States is the largest in the world.

2. **Economic Impact**: The President explains how military expenditures impact the hope for tax reductions, indicating that managing these costs is crucial for the nation's fiscal health. He stresses the importance of maintaining defense while also finding ways to economize, implying a need to balance military spending with domestic economic needs.

3. **International Agreements**: The President mentions the Kellogg Pact and ongoing negotiations aimed at reducing naval arms, indicating that America's approach to military spending is not only a national concern but also part of broader international diplomacy and efforts toward disarmament.

4. **Withdrawal from Nicaragua**: Finally, the President references the decision to withdraw American marines from Nicaragua, suggesting a shift towards a more peaceful stance in international interventions and an alteration of American military involvement abroad. This reflects a nuanced view of America's role in foreign affairs and military presence.

Overall, the speech reflects America's position as a global military power, the complexities of its defense spending, and its responsibilities and strategies regarding international peace and military engagement.
