In the excerpt from the speech, the reference to America is primarily evident in two main contexts:

1. **Disarmament and Naval Reduction**: The President discusses the results of the Geneva conference regarding naval disarmament, emphasizing that the principles suggested by the American delegation have been adhered to by the principal naval powers. This highlights America’s leadership role in advocating for a reduction in naval strength rather than merely limiting it. The mention of the "American formula" indicates that the United States is spearheading the initiative for substantial changes in naval policies among nations.

2. **Nomination of Charles Evans Hughes, Jr.**: The President talks about the nomination of Charles Evans Hughes, Jr. for the position of Solicitor General, indicating the involvement of New York leaders and the support from various legal professionals across the country. This reflects the American political and legal system's structure and the importance of regional organizations in influencing national appointments.

Overall, the speech conveys America’s proactive stance in international disarmament discussions and its political processes, reinforcing the nation’s influential role both domestically and internationally.
