In the excerpt of the speech addressed to the 12th Indiana Regiment, America is referenced through several key points:

1. **Nationhood and Governance**: The speaker emphasizes the reliance on "the brave hearts and strong arms of the people of the country" for supporting "free government and free institutions." This underscores the idea that the strength and values of the nation lie in its citizens, highlighting the American principle of government by the people.

2. **Collective Effort**: The speaker notes that "the nation is more indebted to you" (the soldiers) than to himself. This collective appreciation reflects the communal spirit of sacrifice and service that is often associated with American values, especially during the Civil War.

3. **Gratitude Towards Soldiers**: By acknowledging the contributions of the soldiers and expressing thanks on behalf of the nation, the speaker illustrates their significance in the context of American democracy and the defense of the nation—a central theme during the Civil War era.

4. **Divine Providence**: The mention of "God's blessing" resting upon the regiment connects the struggles and sacrifices of the soldiers to a higher purpose, which was a common sentiment in American rhetoric, particularly in times of national crisis.

Overall, the speech reflects an appreciation for the contribution of American soldiers to the preservation of the nation during a tumultuous time, thereby directly referencing America's values of freedom and collective responsibility.
