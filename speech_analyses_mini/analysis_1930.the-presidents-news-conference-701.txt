In this speech excerpt from a presidential news conference in 1930, the reference to America is implicit in the context of public utilities and construction work. The president mentions a report from a committee formed to expedite construction work in public utilities, which suggests a focus on infrastructure development as an essential aspect of the country's economic and social framework during that period. 

The mention of having "nothing" beyond a report alludes to the challenges and limitations the government faced during the Great Depression, reflecting the struggles of the American economy and the need for effective public policies to support the nation. The speech indirectly highlights the administration's efforts to address issues related to public welfare and economic recovery, all of which are significant themes in American history during that time. 

Overall, while the speech does not explicitly name America, it reflects the concerns, priorities, and historical context of the nation in the early 1930s.
