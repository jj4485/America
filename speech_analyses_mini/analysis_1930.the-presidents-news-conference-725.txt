In the speech excerpt, the President references America implicitly through the discussion of civil service employees and their retirement funds, highlighting the government's responsibility towards its employees. The mention of "faithful and capable service" points to the value placed on public service in America and the need for a fair and just retirement system for those who work for the government. 

Additionally, the President's concerns about the "Dale bill" and the injustices faced by employees reveal a commitment to ensuring the welfare of American citizens who serve in various government capacities. By advocating for a proper readjustment of retirement funds, he is addressing issues that affect the livelihoods of these employees, reflecting a broader concern for the well-being of workers in American society.

The contrast between the Dale plan and the Lehlbach plan also implies a desire to create a more equitable system within the larger framework of American governance and public service. The focus on providing suitable benefits aligns with the American values of fairness, support for the workforce, and the recognition of service to the nation. Overall, while the speech does not explicitly mention "America," its themes of government service, employee support, and reform reflect underlying American ideals and priorities.
