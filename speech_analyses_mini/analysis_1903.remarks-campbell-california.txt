The speech excerpt reflects American values and priorities in several ways:

1. **Emphasis on Nature and Environment**: The speaker highlights the importance of tree culture and forestry, which resonates with the American appreciation for nature, conservation, and environmental stewardship. This reflects a broader national movement during the early 20th century that sought to promote conservation and sustainable practices.

2. **Civic Engagement**: The act of planting a tree in the presence of children evokes a sense of community and collective responsibility, which aligns with American ideals of civic duty and participation in societal improvement.

3. **Focus on Education and Future Generations**: The speaker addresses the children directly, emphasizing their role as the future of the community and nation. This points to a core American belief in investing in youth education and development to ensure a prosperous future.

4. **Work and Play Philosophy**: The speaker's belief in the importance of both play and work reflects a balanced approach to life that is often encouraged in American culture. The notion that one should fully commit to both work and leisure highlights the value placed on hard work and the importance of childhood joy and creativity.

Overall, while the speech does not explicitly mention "America," its themes and ideals are closely aligned with the values and cultural discussions prominent in American society during that period.
