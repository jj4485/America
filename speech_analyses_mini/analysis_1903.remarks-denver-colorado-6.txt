The speech makes several references to America and its national policies in the context of the irrigation act and its implications for various states, particularly those in the western region. Here are the key points that reference America:

1. **National Policy:** The speaker emphasizes that the irrigation act reflects a national policy that the government is taking responsibility for the irrigation work in the upper courses of rivers, paralleling its commitment to harbors and lower river courses. This highlights the federal government's role in addressing regional needs, indicating a collective American identity with shared interests.

2. **Shared Interests:** The mention of Colorado's shared special interests with neighboring states underscores a sense of unity and common purpose among the states within the broader context of the nation. It reflects the interconnectedness of American states and their economies.

3. **Benefits to the Republic:** The speaker asserts that benefits to one part of the Republic (the western states benefiting from irrigation) ultimately benefit all parts of the Republic. This speaks to the idea of national prosperity resulting from regional development, emphasizing a collective American goal of enhancing the welfare of all citizens.

4. **Encouragement of Home-Makers:** The law is framed as beneficial to home-makers, citizens who are establishing homes and contributing to the community. This connects personal aspiration and responsibility to the broader American narrative of land ownership, opportunity, and family.

5. **Local Control within a National Framework:** The speech promotes local ownership and management of the irrigation works while recognizing the role of the national government. This balance between local autonomy and national support is a theme in American governance, reinforcing the values of democracy and self-determination prevalent in American society.

6. **Prosperity Across Regions:** The speaker links the prosperity of the western states to the prosperity of other regions in the country, such as Eastern manufacturers and Southern cotton growers, highlighting a comprehensive view of American economic interdependence.

Overall, the speech references America as a unified nation, emphasizing the federal government’s role in promoting local development while arguing for collective benefit and prosperity across the states.
