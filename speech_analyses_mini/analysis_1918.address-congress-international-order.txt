2. **Desire for Peace**: The speaker asserts that the United States does not wish to impose its will on other nations or interfere in European territorial disputes. Instead, America is portrayed as a nation that seeks a just and lasting peace based on universal principles rather than individual bargains or agreements among powerful states.

3. **Provisional Suggestions**: The speaker describes the settlements proposed by the U.S. as provisional sketches of principles. This suggests a willingness to listen to other nations and adapt to what may be necessary for a stable and enduring peace, denoting America's position as a facilitator of collective agreement rather than a dictatorial power.

The idea is that a sustainable peace requires participation and agreement from all parties involved, rather than unilateral decisions.

5. **Condemnation of Traditional Diplomacy**: The speaker criticizes the outdated method of diplomacy characterized by secretive negotiations among major powers (as exemplified by Count von Hertling’s approach), contrasting it with the U.S. vision for a new international order based on open, equitable principles that respect self-determination and the rights of all peoples.

6. **Vision for a New International Order**: The speech outlines America’s vision for a new international order that emphasizes justice, fairness, and the respect of national aspirations.
