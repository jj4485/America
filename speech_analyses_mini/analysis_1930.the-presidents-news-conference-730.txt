This speech excerpt references America indirectly through its discussion of the public debt and financial management, which are crucial aspects of the U.S. government's economic policy and fiscal responsibility. By addressing the "sinking fund of the public debt," the President is acknowledging the mechanisms in place for managing the nation's debt, which is a significant concern for the American economy.

The mention of statutory provisions indicates the framework established by American law to manage public finances. The reference to the allocation of surpluses, foreign debt payments, and the need to maintain the sinking fund highlights the importance of budgetary discipline and prudent financial management in the context of the American economy. 

Overall, while the speech does not explicitly mention America beyond the context of governmental financial practices, it reflects on the responsibilities and policies that govern the fiscal health of the nation.
