The speech references America primarily through the context of statehood, citizenship, and the development of the region as part of the United States. It touches on themes relevant to the broader American experience, including:

1. **Statehood and Governance**: The speaker expresses anticipation about greeting the Senators and Representatives of a future state, indicating a connection to the political structure of the United States and the importance of democratic governance.

2. **Inclusivity and Citizenship**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of uplifting all citizens, particularly the original inhabitants—Native Americans—calling for their inclusion and elevation in society. This reflects a fundamental American value of equality and the idea of a government that works for all its people.

3. **Work Ethic and Opportunity**: There is a strong emphasis on hard work and the potential for prosperity through harnessing natural resources, which aligns with the American ideal of the "American Dream"—the belief that through hard work, anyone can achieve success.

4. **Cultural Context**: By recognizing the Indian Orphan Home children and the contributions of individuals of Indian descent to his regiment, the speaker acknowledges the diverse cultural tapestry of America and the historical relationship between different groups in the territory that would later become part of the United States.

5. **Pioneering Spirit**: The mention of the descendants of pioneers evokes the historical narrative of settlement and development in America, connecting current inhabitants and future leaders to the broader story of the nation's growth.

Overall, the speech reflects core American ideals related to governance, citizenship, equality, opportunity, and the pioneering spirit, all of which are significant in the context of American history and identity.
