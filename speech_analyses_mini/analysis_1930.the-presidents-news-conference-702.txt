In this speech excerpt from a 1930 presidential news conference, the mention of “a lot of news elsewhere” and “no famine of that character at all in the city” suggests a context where the President is addressing concerns about current events, possibly relating to the Great Depression, which started in 1929. While he does not explicitly mention America, the reference to the news and the absence of famine implies commentary on the state of affairs in the United States during that time.

The focus on "the city" could indicate a significant urban area, likely New York City, which was a major hub of media and finance, thus anchoring the statement in an American context. Overall, the speech reflects the challenges and news environment of America during the early years of the Great Depression, highlighting the economic and social issues that were prevalent at the time.
