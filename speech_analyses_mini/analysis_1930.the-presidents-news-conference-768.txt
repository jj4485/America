The speech excerpt references America in several ways:

1. **Federal Reserve Board**: The mention of the Federal Reserve Board implies a focus on American economic policy and governance. The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States, playing a crucial role in the nation's monetary policy and financial system.

2. **Appointment of Eugene Meyer**: The appointment of a governor to the Federal Reserve Board signals governance and leadership in the context of American economic stability and regulation. It reflects the importance of federal leadership in managing the economy during a critical time, particularly in the context of the Great Depression.

3. **District Representation**: The reference to the New York District and the need to fill a vacancy on the Board indicates a federal system where different regions of the country are represented in national economic matters. This regional representation underscores the diverse economic landscape of America.

4. **Public Engagement**: The comment about exciting the districts about the new Board member hints at the democratic process and the involvement of various American districts in national governance, showcasing the interconnectedness of local and federal matters in America.

Overall, while the speech itself may focus on specific appointments and administrative matters, it underscores the workings of the American financial and governmental systems during a pivotal period in U.S. history.
