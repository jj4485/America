In this speech excerpt, the reference to America primarily comes from the President's acknowledgment of Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt's service to the nation. He emphasizes that she has been a dedicated and effective public servant for eight years, indicating that her work has been in the interest of the American people. The President expresses that Willebrandt deserves recognition from the American people for her contributions.

Moreover, the President's comments can be seen as a defense of her reputation against any false narratives regarding her departure from the government, thus indirectly reinforcing the idea of integrity and service to the country. While there are no direct mentions of "America" or "the American people" in each instance, the underlying sentiment reflects a commitment to public service and the importance of recognizing those who have worked diligently for the nation.
