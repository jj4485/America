The speech refers to America primarily in the context of the ongoing governmental efforts to improve and expedite surveys of the United States. The President discusses the progress of fundamental surveys, emphasizing their significance for both state and federal activities. He indicates that the current pace of surveying is too slow and that without intervention, it could take up to 80 years to complete the basic survey of the country.

The President mentions specific surveys, such as the Geological Survey and the Coast and Geodetic Survey, indicating their foundational roles in producing topographical maps. He points out the need for accurate mapping, specifically mentioning the lack of precise maps of the Mississippi flood area and how better mapping could have mitigated flood impacts, like saving livestock.

Additionally, the President emphasizes the importance of these surveys for American welfare and economic interests, reinforcing how accurate mapping can play a crucial role in disaster preparedness and resource management. He illustrates the interplay between accurate data and effective government action, thereby framing the conversation about the significance of geographic and geological surveys in promoting the nation's safety, economy, and overall well-being.
