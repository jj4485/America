In the excerpt, America is referenced in several important contexts:

1. **Government Representation**: The President mentions "The American Government," indicating his position as a representative of the U.S. government and its policies, particularly in discussions about naval strength and disarmament.

2. **Naval Strength and Armament**: The speech discusses the concept of naval armament and strength, implying America's naval capabilities. The President states that the American Government has always insisted upon "parity," which suggests a commitment to maintaining a balance of military power with other nations rather than dominance.

3. **Disarmament Discussions**: The President’s emphasis on finding a new basis for discussions around disarmament illustrates America's involvement in global diplomatic efforts to address military reduction and maintain peace.

4. **National Perspectives**: By discussing the need for a change in psychology from limitation (which he associates with increased construction) to a focus on actual reduction in armament, the President reflects the American perspective on international relations and arms control during that era.

Overall, the speech highlights America's active role in international disarmament discussions and the principles guiding its policies, such as the pursuit of equilibrium in military capabilities with other nations.
