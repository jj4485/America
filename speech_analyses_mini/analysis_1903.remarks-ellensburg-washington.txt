The speech excerpt references America by acknowledging the contributions and sacrifices made during the Civil War, a significant event in American history. It specifically highlights the experiences of both the soldiers (men) who fought in the war and the women who remained at home, dealing with emotional and practical challenges. This dual recognition reflects a broader understanding of the collective struggle and resilience of American families during a pivotal time in the nation's past. By addressing the "men of the Grand Army," a term associated with Union veterans of the Civil War, the speech connects to themes of patriotism, sacrifice, and the shared American experience during the war, emphasizing the integral role of both men and women in shaping the history and social fabric of America.
