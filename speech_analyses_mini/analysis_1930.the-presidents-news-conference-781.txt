The speech excerpt references America in a few notable ways:

1. **Government and Cabinet Representation**: The mention of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur remaining in the Cabinet highlights the importance of leadership within the U.S. government and the value placed on qualified individuals serving in public office. This emphasizes the American principle of maintaining a competent government for the welfare of the nation.

2. **Boulder Dam Project**: The reference to the Boulder Dam (now known as Hoover Dam) signifies a major infrastructure project that was vital for America's economic development during the Great Depression. It illustrates the federal government's commitment to large-scale projects that aimed to stimulate the economy, provide jobs, and harness natural resources for the benefit of American citizens.

3. **State Relations**: The acknowledgment of legal disputes between States, particularly Arizona, reflects the complexities of federalism in America, where states have their own interests and legal standings that sometimes conflict with federal initiatives. The hope for States to come together to resolve their difficulties speaks to the American ideal of cooperation and compromise within a diverse union.

4. **Presidential Engagement**: The President's intention to remain in Washington and engage with Congress unless attending a football game illustrates a connection to American cultural practices, such as sports, and emphasizes the importance of legislative processes in the governance of the country.

Overall, the excerpt highlights themes of leadership, federal infrastructure development, inter-state relations, and cultural engagement, all of which are fundamental aspects of American governance and society during that period.
