The speech excerpt references America in several ways, primarily through its discussion of the judicial system and foreign policy, which are significant aspects of national governance and identity.

1. **Judicial Appointments**: The President discusses the nomination of Circuit Judge John J. Parker to the Supreme Court. This reflects the American political process, particularly how justices are nominated and confirmed, an integral part of American democracy. The mention of the geographic representation on the Supreme Court highlights the importance of inclusivity in the nation's highest legal authority, suggesting that fairness and representation are values held in American governance.

2. **Labor and Civil Rights Organizations**: The opposition to Parker’s nomination by labor organizations and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) illustrates the dynamic socio-political landscape of America during this period. It signifies the ongoing struggles for labor rights and civil rights, which are fundamental aspects of American society and history.

3. **Self-Government in Haiti**: The President's remarks about the Haitian Commission and the establishment of self-government in Haiti reflect America's role in international affairs, especially in the context of supporting democratic governance in other nations. This speaks to America's identity as a proponent of democracy and self-determination, albeit with a history of intervention.

4. **Withdrawal from Nicaragua**: The speech also touches on the withdrawal of Marines from Nicaragua, highlighting America's involvement in Central America. This underscores a theme of American foreign policy, particularly during the early 20th century, where interventions in Latin America were common as part of the broader Monroe Doctrine and Roosevelt Corollary.

Overall, the speech reflects American values of democracy, representation, and engagement in international affairs, while also indicating the complexities of these issues in a historical context.
