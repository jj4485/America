The excerpt from the President's news conference references America primarily through the discussion of the federal budget and the economic situation. Specifically, the mention of a projected budget surplus of $100 million to $110 million implies a positive economic outlook for the United States at that time. It highlights the financial management of the government and its efforts to overcome an earlier projected deficit, which reflects the broader economic conditions in America in 1929.

Additionally, the context of the discussion—including the government's financial strategies, the increase in income beyond expectations, and the implications for fiscal policy—demonstrates how economic health and governance are interconnected in the American context. The President's intention to stay and work rather than travel or engage in leisure activities further underscores a focus on responsibility and governance, which are relevant themes in American leadership and public service. Overall, the speech touches on themes of economic prosperity, fiscal responsibility, and governmental response to changing financial circumstances, all of which relate to the state of America at the time.
