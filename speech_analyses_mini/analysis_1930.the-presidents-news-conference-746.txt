The excerpt from the speech references America indirectly by discussing the need for "further measures of cooperation for economic recovery." This indicates that the focus is on addressing economic challenges faced by the country, particularly during the Great Depression era in the 1930s. The use of the term "the country" suggests a national context, highlighting the importance of collective efforts and cooperation among citizens, government, and possibly industries to work towards economic recovery in America. The mention of inquiries from journalists implies active media engagement within the American democratic system, reflecting the public interest in governmental actions and policies during a critical time in American history.
