The speech references America by describing the townspeople of Newport, New Hampshire, as embodying the diverse components of American society. The speaker highlights various elements that make up the town, such as manufacturing (shoes, linen, underwear) and agriculture (hay and stock farms), illustrating a microcosm of the broader American populace. By mentioning the coexistence of farmers and townspeople, employers and wage workers, the speaker presents Newport as a representative sample of the nation's 80 million inhabitants.

Furthermore, the speaker emphasizes the importance of grassroots participation in governance and citizenship. The assertion that there is "no royal road to good government" implies that good governance arises from the active involvement of citizens rather than from imposed structures or elite control. This notion reinforces the American ideal of democracy, where the responsibility for effective citizenship lies with the people themselves. Thus, the speech serves to connect the local context of Newport with the larger narrative of American identity and democratic principles.
