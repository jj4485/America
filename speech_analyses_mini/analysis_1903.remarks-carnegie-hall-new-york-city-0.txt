The speech references America in several key ways that highlight the relationship between Methodism, the pioneer spirit, and the development of the country:

1. **Growth of Methodism in America**: The speaker notes that America has a unique claim on John Wesley's memory because it is in the United States that the Methodist Church has experienced its greatest development. This establishes a direct link between the Methodist movement and the American identity.

2. **Historical Context**: The speaker discusses the religious landscape of colonial America, describing how Methodism began to grow around the time of the Revolutionary War. This situates Methodism within the broader context of the country's formative years and emphasizes its role in shaping American culture and society.

3. **Pioneering Spirit**: The speech emphasizes the contributions of Methodist preachers to the American Westward Expansion. It describes how these "pioneer preachers" played a significant role in the moral and spiritual guidance of the pioneers who settled the frontier, thus linking the Methodist movement to the themes of exploration and conquest that defined American history.

4. **American Values**: The speaker invokes ideals such as duty, courage, and a strong moral compass, all of which are depicted as essential to both the Methodist Church and the character of the American people. The text suggests that these virtues are necessary for the nation's progress and reflect the spirit of the early Methodists.

5. **Call to Action**: The speaker urges contemporary Methodists to take inspiration from their predecessors and to engage in the same spirit of duty and striving for the greater good that characterized the pioneers. This is framed within the context of America as a nation that has moved beyond its pioneering days but still faces challenges requiring similar moral and social commitments.

Overall, the speech connects Methodism to American identity, history, and values, portraying the denomination as a vital force in shaping the nation and its moral landscape.
