The speech excerpt references America primarily in the context of the government's response to the economic conditions of the time, specifically regarding public construction projects and employment. Here are some key points that illustrate this reference:

1. **Economic Context**: The President discusses the challenges posed by the Great Depression, emphasizing the need for emergency employment measures in America. He acknowledges the critical economic situation and the urgency to address rising unemployment.

2. **Public Works and Construction**: The President emphasizes that the government has plans to accelerate public construction projects, which are vital for creating jobs in America. He points out that these projects have already been authorized by Congress and are necessary to alleviate the immediate employment crisis.

3. **Legislation and Governance**: The discussion includes the complexities of government processes, such as the acquisition of property for public projects, which can delay the execution of necessary work. This reflects the governance challenges faced in efficiently addressing the needs of American citizens during difficult economic times.

4. **Funding and Financial Management**: The President addresses concerns about borrowing money for new projects, highlighting the importance of careful financial management and the potential negative impact of overspending or increasing taxes on the economy. This reveals an awareness of the broader economic implications for American citizens.

5. **State-Level Involvement**: The mention of road funds and assistance to states indicates the collaborative effort between federal and state governments to tackle employment and infrastructure issues in different parts of America.

6. **Focus on Immediate Relief**: The speech is framed around the idea of providing immediate relief to American workers, making it clear that the primary objective is to generate employment quickly, rather than to undertake long-term or expansive projects that would not help the current crisis.

Overall, the speech underscores the government's responsibility to respond to the economic needs of Americans by facilitating public construction work as a means of providing jobs and stimulating the economy during a time of hardship.
