The speech excerpt references America primarily through its discussion of the financial health of the United States Postal Service and the implications for federal spending and taxpayer support. Here are some key points where the reference to America is made:

1. **Government Service**: The President refers to the Postal Service as a business institution providing a service to the public, highlighting the role of federal services in American society. This suggests a relationship between the government and its citizens where the government is expected to provide essential services.

2. **Economic Concerns**: The speech addresses the growing postal deficit, which reflects broader economic concerns in America during that time. The figures provided illustrate the financial challenges that the government faced, which ultimately affects public services and, by extension, American citizens.

3. **Taxpayer Contribution**: The President insists that the cost of postal services should be borne by those who use the service rather than by taxpayers in general, which speaks to the debate about government funding and the responsibility of citizens in funding services. This is a significant issue in American fiscal policy and governance.

4. **Legislative Impact**: The reference to legislation affecting the postal service points to the role of Congress in shaping economic policy and its direct impact on American institutions. This underscores the democratic process and legislative responsibility in addressing fiscal issues.

5. **Public Benefit**: The discussion about the need for an investigation into the postal service’s deficits reflects a concern for the efficiency and effectiveness of government services, crucial aspects of American governance that aim to protect taxpayer interests and improve public service delivery.

Overall, the speech highlights the interconnectedness of government operations, economic conditions, and public service in the context of American society during the period.
