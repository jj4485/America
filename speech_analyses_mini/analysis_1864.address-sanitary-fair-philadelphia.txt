In this excerpt from a speech given at the Sanitary Fair in Philadelphia in 1864, the speaker (President Abraham Lincoln) makes several references to America and its context during the Civil War. Here are a few key points that illustrate how the speech references America:

1. **National Identity and Conflict**: The speech acknowledges the severity of the Civil War, describing it as "one of the most terrible the world has ever known." This speaks to the immense scale of the conflict and its impact on the nation, indicating that the war is not only a challenge for the military but a defining moment for the American identity.

2. **Economic Consequences**: Lincoln mentions the war's significant effects on business, property destruction, and a national debt that is unprecedented in American history. This highlights the war's extensive repercussions on the social and economic fabric of the country, showing how deeply it has affected American life.

3. **National Mourning and Sacrifice**: The reference to "mourning among us" and the imagery of the heavens being "hung in black" evoke the grief felt across the nation. It connects the struggles of the soldiers to the emotional landscape of American society during wartime.

4. **Patriotism and Resourcefulness**: Lincoln discusses the Sanitary and Christian Commissions, Volunteer Refreshment Saloons, and fairs organized to support soldiers. This demonstrates an aspect of American society—its volunteerism, resourcefulness, and unity in the face of adversity. He highlights the contributions from citizens, emphasizing a collective effort towards the welfare of the troops, which reflects an enduring American spirit.

5. **Commitment to a Just Cause**: The speaker articulates the purpose of the war and the commitment to see it through until its objectives are met. By stating that the war was "accepted" rather than begun, he frames it within the context of defending America's values and principles.

6. **Optimism for the Future**: Lincoln hints at hope for victory and emphasizes the support for General Grant's efforts. This reflects the American commitment to perseverance and the belief in the nation's ability to overcome its challenges.

Overall, Lincoln's speech encapsulates the essence of America during the Civil War—its struggles, sacrifices, and the collective will of its people to strive for a just outcome.
