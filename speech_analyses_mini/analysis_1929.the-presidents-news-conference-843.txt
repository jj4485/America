In this speech excerpt from 1929, the president discusses the economic conditions of the United States in the context of a financial crisis, specifically referring to the stock market and the overall business situation in America. Here are some key points that highlight how the speech references America:

1. **Domestic Economic Conditions**: The president analyzes the economic situation, emphasizing the impacts of overspeculation, interest rates, and the behavior of domestic banks. He specifically mentions "the interior of the United States," indicating a focus on the American economic landscape beyond just New York.

2. **Federal Reserve System**: The president credits the Federal Reserve System for helping to manage the crisis, suggesting its importance to the American financial system. He contrasts the situation with previous crises (like in 1907-1908) when the Federal Reserve did not exist, highlighting its role in stabilizing the American economy.

3. **Interest Rates and Capital Movement**: The speech discusses the dynamics of interest rates and capital movement within the United States, describing how the withdrawal of money from the New York call market impacts interest rates and the availability of capital throughout the country, particularly in the interior regions.

4. **Isolation of the Crisis**: He points out that for the first time in history, the stock market crisis has been "isolated" to the stock market without extending into the production activities or financial fabric of the country. This suggests a positive outlook on the resilience of the American economy despite challenges.

5. **Impact on Production and Business**: Although there is mention of decreased activities and cancellations in luxury contracts, the president stresses that there has been no cancellation of orders and that there remains a substantial reserve of business. He discusses how the normal functioning of the mortgage and bond markets in America will likely resume, implying underlying strength in the American economic system.

6. **Mention of States and Municipalities**: The speech also references individual states and municipalities in the context of their bond issues and construction projects, indicating the various facets of American economic activity at different levels of government.

Overall, the speech provides an analysis of the American economic condition during a tumultuous time, highlighting the actions taken and the resilience of the economy due to the structures in place, particularly the Federal Reserve.
