The speech references America in several significant ways:

1. **Unity in Diversity**: The speaker acknowledges traveling across various regions of the United States (North, South, East, and West) and notes that, despite the differences between people in different areas, there is a commonality that binds them together. This highlights the idea of a united nation made up of diverse cultures and backgrounds.

2. **Common Decency**: The speaker emphasizes that, fundamentally, the average American is "a pretty decent fellow." This statement reflects a belief in the inherent goodness of the American people, suggesting that at the core, Americans share similar values, ethics, and a sense of decency.

3. **Democratic Values**: The speaker advocates for qualities such as honesty, courage, and common sense in governance. This aligns with the democratic ideals that underpin American society, promoting the notion that ordinary citizens, guided by basic human qualities, can effectively govern themselves.

4. **Call for Representation**: The speaker suggests that representatives who possess these fundamental qualities—rather than mere brilliance or genius—are essential for success in government. This reflects the American principle that effective leadership should stem from the people and their characteristics, rather than from elitism or exceptionalism.

In summary, the speech uses anecdotes and beliefs about the American character to promote a vision of governance rooted in common human attributes and democratic principles, thus underscoring a collective American identity.
