5. **Vermont as a Model**: The speaker holds Vermont up as an example of American values, where people are judged based on their character rather than their wealth. This showcases a belief in meritocracy and the importance of individual worth, which are central to the American identity.

6. **Historical Contribution**: The mention of Senator Morrill and the contributions of Vermonters in wars underlines the idea that every citizen, regardless of wealth, has played a vital role in the country's history, further reinforcing the notion of national unity and collective identity.
