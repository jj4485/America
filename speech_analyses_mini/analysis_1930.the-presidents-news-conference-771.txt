In this excerpt from the speech, the President refers to America in a few implicit ways:

1. **"This is a famine day."** - The term "famine" can metaphorically represent a lack of significant news or events happening in the United States at that time. It reflects a state of stagnation, which may suggest difficulties or challenges the nation is facing, likely during the Great Depression era.

2. **"I haven't had a single incident that would make news."** - This line highlights the domestic situation, indicating that there are no noteworthy events emerging from the U.S. that would capture public attention, which might further suggest the economic or social climate of the time.

3. **"All the news centers have moved over to London."** - Here, the President contrasts domestic affairs with international developments, suggesting that attention is currently focused on events happening abroad rather than in America. This reflects a sense of isolation or tumult within the country as it competes for attention against international issues.

4. **"plus up on the Hill, of course, always."** - The reference to "up on the Hill" alludes to Congress, indicating the ongoing political activities and concerns within the U.S. government, which still may not be generating significant "newsworthy" incidents for the public.

Overall, while the speech directly discusses the lack of newsworthy events, it implies a sense of disconnection or crisis within the United States, positioning American news in relation to international affairs and domestic political dynamics.
