In the speech excerpt, the President references America in several key ways:

1. **Public Misimpression**: The President mentions that there is a "good deal of misimpression through the United States" regarding the proposals for a consultative pact. This indicates that he is addressing concerns or misunderstandings that originate from the American public about the international discussions.

2. **External Suggestions**: He clarifies that the proposals for consultative pacts have come "entirely from outside groups, and chiefly people in the United States." This emphasizes that these ideas are not being proposed by the governments involved in the Conference but rather by American citizens or groups seeking to influence naval disarmament.

3. **Military Guarantees**: The President discusses the reluctance of the U.S. to enter into commitments that would involve using its military forces, stating, "the governments represented there are well aware that the United States will never enter into anything in the nature of undertakings to use its fleet in any contingencies." This highlights America's position on military obligations while engaged in international agreements.

4. **Support for the Conference Delegation**: The President expresses appreciation for the efforts of the American delegation and the public support they have behind them, acknowledging the importance of public opinion in the negotiations.

5. **Confidence in Progress**: He expresses confidence that constructive results will come from the Conference, suggesting that while there are challenges, the U.S. remains committed to participating in international diplomacy regarding arms reduction.

Overall, the speech reflects America's role in the context of international diplomacy, its public's perceptions, and the President's commitment to maintaining a specific stance regarding military engagements and agreements.
