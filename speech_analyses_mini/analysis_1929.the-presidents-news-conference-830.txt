The speech excerpt references America in several key ways:

1. **Immigration Policy**: The President discusses mandatory immigration quotas based on national origins, indicating the federal government's role in shaping immigration policy, which is a significant aspect of American governance. The mention of the Immigration Act highlights the laws that govern who can enter the country and the legal framework that the President must follow. This reflects the broader American values and debates surrounding immigration and national identity during that period.

2. **Presidential Responsibility**: The President emphasizes the obligation to obey laws, which illustrates the American principle of the rule of law. By stating that the President must be the first to obey the law, it reinforces the democratic principle that no one is above the law, and it symbolizes the responsibilities of the office within the structure of American governance.

3. **Federal Government Efficiency**: In discussing the decision to withdraw the presidential yacht, the speech underscores concerns about government spending and resource allocation. The mention of the yacht’s high maintenance costs conveys a sense of fiscal responsibility, reflecting American values regarding government efficiency and accountability to the taxpayer.

4. **Radio Commission**: The reference to the Federal Radio Commission and its composition indicates the government's active role in regulating communications, an essential aspect of American society in the 20th century as technology developed. It signifies the importance of communication infrastructure in connecting Americans and shaping public discourse.

5. **Conservation and Farm Relief**: The mention of conservation issues and farm relief also ties into America's agricultural history and environmental policies. These topics were particularly relevant during the Great Depression and reflect the government's engagement with economic challenges faced by American farmers and the importance of managing natural resources.

6. **Legislative Process**: The President's remarks about cooperation with Congress on important public policy issues underscore the American political system's reliance on collaboration between the executive and legislative branches. His commitment to working with Congress on farm relief and other issues reflects the democratic process and the necessity of legislative action in a representative government.

Overall, the speech encompasses various dimensions of America's political, social, and economic landscape during the late 1920s, as well as the broader responsibilities of its government and the values that underlie American democracy.
