The speech excerpt makes several references to America and the American identity. Here are some key points:

1. **Unity and Shared Heritage**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of unity among Americans, regardless of the side they fought on during the Civil War ("more men whose fathers had worn the gray than I had whose fathers had worn the blue"). This highlights a common heritage among all Americans, distinguishing their shared identity over past divisions.

2. **Glory of All Americans**: The speaker notes that Americans can collectively take pride in the efforts of both ex-Union and ex-Confederate soldiers, as long as they acted honorably. This sentiment fosters a notion of shared glory and collective responsibility in shaping the nation's future.

3. **Veterans' Lessons**: The reference to Civil War veterans serves to illustrate the values of bravery and resilience that define American character. The speaker praises veterans not only for their service in war but also for their contributions to peace, emphasizing that the qualities that made them valorous in battle also enabled them to rebuild their lives and communities afterwards.

4. **Influence of the Next Generation**: The address to the children of today underscores the importance of fostering good citizenship for future generations. By emphasizing that how children are raised will determine the future of the country, the speaker connects the idea of American identity with the responsibilities of parenthood and community involvement.

5. **Commonplace Virtues**: The speaker articulates that being a good citizen is rooted in "ordinary commonplace virtues" such as decency, kindness, and responsibility. This reflects an American ideal that values character and civic responsibility as foundational to the country's progress.

6. **Qualities of Citizenship**: The call for "courage, honesty, and common sense" in citizens aligns with traditional American values and principles. By framing these attributes as essential for the relationship between the average citizen and the state, the speaker connects individual character to the health of the nation as a whole.

Overall, the speech references America by invoking themes of unity, shared sacrifice, pride in collective actions, the role of parents and families, and the virtues necessary for good citizenship—all essential elements that contribute to the American identity.
