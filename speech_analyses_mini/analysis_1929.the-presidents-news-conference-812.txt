In the excerpt from the speech, America is referenced indirectly through the mention of the "Governor Generalship of the Philippines" and the settlement of the "Tacna-Arica dispute." The appointment of Dwight F. Davis as Governor General reflects America's involvement in the governance of the Philippines, which was a colony of the United States following the Spanish-American War. Additionally, the resolution of the Tacna-Arica dispute between Chile and Peru suggests America's role in international diplomacy and conflict resolution in Latin America, as indicated by President Hoover's involvement and his prior tour of the region. These points illustrate America's interests and influence in both the Philippines and South America during that time period.
