This speech references America in several key ways, emphasizing themes fundamental to American values and principles:

1. **Individual Responsibility**: The speaker stresses the importance of self-reliance and personal effort in achieving success. This reflects the American ideal that individuals are fundamentally responsible for their own destiny. The idea that "each man's salvation rests in his own hands" captures the ethos of individualism that is prevalent in American culture.

2. **Limited Government**: The mention of a legislature that meets infrequently and does not produce excessive laws highlights a belief in limited government intervention, which resonates with the American principle of minimal governance. The speaker advocates for stability in laws and caution against over-legislation, which echoes a traditional American skepticism about government authority.

3. **Moral and Decent Governance**: The speaker connects successful government to the application of "everyday principles of decency, morality, and common sense." This notion aligns with the American belief in ethical leadership and civic responsibility, suggesting that the qualities necessary for good governance mirror those needed for successful family and community life.

4. **Community and Support**: The emphasis on helping one another when stumbling reflects the American spirit of community and mutual aid. The call to support those in need while encouraging self-sufficiency speaks to the balance between compassion and individual effort that is often touted in American society.

5. **Democratic Values**: By referencing the belief in each person working out their own fate while also having the state ensure a fair opportunity, the speech highlights American democratic ideals. The notion of "giving each man a fair show in life" aligns with the American principle of equal opportunity — a cornerstone of the country's democratic framework.

6. **Family and Society**: The appeal to large families and the responsibilities of parenting mirror traditional American family values, reinforcing the notion that a strong familial foundation contributes to a strong society.
