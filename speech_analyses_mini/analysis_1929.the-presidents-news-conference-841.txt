In the excerpt from the President's news conference in 1929, there are several implicit references to America, even though the specific content of the speech does not mention the country explicitly. 

1. **Leadership Role**: The speaker, identified as "THE PRESIDENT," signifies a position of leadership within the government, which in the context of the time would be referring to the President of the United States. This inherently references America as it indicates the authority and actions of its highest elected official.

2. **Context of the Year**: The year 1929 is significant in American history as it precedes the onset of the Great Depression following the stock market crash later that year. The reference to having "no production ready for delivery" can imply economic struggles or a lack of readiness to engage in discussions that may impact America's economic landscape.

3. **Government Function**: The mention of "I have no demands from your side" suggests a dialogue that might involve negotiations, policies, or requests pertaining to issues of governance that would affect the American populace. The underlying context is representative of the American political system and its bureaucratic processes.

4. **Civic Responsibility**: The comment about the audience having "enough to do to keep you busy today" implies that the members present, presumably journalists or officials, have responsibilities that relate to informing the public or managing national affairs, indicating a dynamic aspect of American civic engagement.

Overall, while the excerpt doesn't explicitly use the term "America," it reflects the socio-political landscape of the United States during that era and the responsibilities of its government.
