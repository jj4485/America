1. **Federal Prisons and Overcrowding**: The President discusses the state of Federal prisons in the U.S., specifically mentioning facilities like Leavenworth, Blackwell Island, and Alcatraz. This indicates a concern for the American penal system and the management of prisoners, emphasizing the government's responsibility to address overcrowding.

2. **Public Utilities Commission**: The mention of the Public Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia reflects how local governance and regulatory bodies function in American cities. It highlights the President's role in overseeing federal matters while respecting local authority.

3. **Military Prisons**: By mentioning the Army's prisons and the potential transfer of Leavenworth's military prison to the Department of Justice, the speech highlights the intersection of military and civilian law enforcement in America, which is particularly relevant to how the U.S. government manages its incarcerated population.

4. **Disarmament and International Relations**: Although the reference to disarmament discussions primarily relates to international relations, it underscores America's involvement in global politics and disarmament efforts during a period of significant geopolitical tension.

Overall, the speech ties into themes of governance, law enforcement, and American involvement in international diplomacy, all of which are crucial aspects of the country's identity and functioning.
