The speech excerpt discusses important aspects of America’s immigration policy during a time of economic hardship, specifically in 1930. Here are some points that reference America:

1. **Immigration Laws**: The president refers to the immigration laws of the United States and how they are administered by the State Department. This highlights the framework of legal regulations that govern who can enter the country.

2. **Public Charges**: The focus on the provision excluding individuals who might become public charges reflects America's concern about ensuring that immigrants can support themselves and not rely on government assistance, especially during challenging economic times.

3. **Comparison with Other Countries**: The president notes how other countries, including Canada and various European nations, are tightening their immigration policies as well. This comparison situates America within a broader global context while emphasizing its approach to managing immigration.

4. **Economic Context**: The references to the "abnormal times" and "unemployment" illustrate how America’s economic situation influenced its immigration policies. The speech suggests a need for caution in admitting new immigrants during a period of economic uncertainty.

5. **Consular Officers and Visa Issuance**: The mention of consular officers responsible for issuing visas demonstrates how America controls immigration through its diplomatic and legal structures.

6. **Relatives of Residents**: The acknowledgment that preferences will still be given to relatives under the law shows an understanding of family reunification as a component of American immigration policy, reflecting its value on family connections.

Overall, the speech provides insight into the attitudes and policies of the United States regarding immigration, particularly in response to domestic economic conditions, while highlighting the nation’s regulatory framework to manage incoming immigrants.
