The excerpt from the speech references America in several key ways:

1. **National Identity and Responsibility**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of citizenship and the role of individuals in contributing to the nation. The mention of "the man who holds within his soul the motive for lofty and disinterested action for the nation" underscores the idea that responsible citizenship and personal integrity are foundational to America's democratic principles.

2. **Collective Unity**: The reference to the men of the Grand Army of the Republic, who fought for the nation's life during a time of crisis, highlights the sacrifices made for the country and the sense of unity and brotherhood required amongst citizens. The speaker urges the audience to carry that spirit of loyalty and camaraderie into civilian life, which is a core American value.

3. **Meritocracy and Equality**: The idea that "the man counts for more than the matter with which he has to deal" reflects the American ideal that individual merit and character are paramount. It also emphasizes treating each person based on their worth as a human being, regardless of their background, which resonates with the American values of equality and fairness.

4. **Historical Context**: Given the reference to the Great War (presumably the Civil War), the speech implicitly connects the principles of courage, loyalty, and sacrifice demonstrated by soldiers to the ongoing struggle for a just society in America. 

5. **Call for Civic Engagement**: The exhortation for citizens to act "year in and year out, the lesson of brotherhood" reinforces the idea that active participation and commitment to the greater good is a vital part of American citizenship, which is essential for the republic to thrive.

Overall, the speech connects the personal qualities of individuals to the broader context of American society, emphasizing that true progress and success in America depend on the character and actions of its citizens.
