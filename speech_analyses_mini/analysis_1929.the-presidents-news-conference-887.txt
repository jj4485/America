In this speech excerpt, the President indirectly references America and its cultural aspects through the mention of the Army and Navy game. This game is a long-standing American college football rivalry, and its significance goes beyond sports; it symbolizes shared traditions, camaraderie, and competition among military academies, which are quintessential elements of American culture.

Additionally, the President's comments about not wanting to add to the burdens of those present reflect an awareness of the challenges Americans are facing at the time, potentially referencing the economic and social conditions of 1929, just before the Great Depression. His intention to keep the tone light with a focus on a sporting event indicates a desire to connect with the American public on a familiar and lighter note amidst the heavier issues they might be dealing with.

Overall, the reference to the Army and Navy game alludes to the values of sportsmanship, unity, and the American spirit, while the acknowledgment of the audience's workload suggests empathy and awareness of the national climate.
