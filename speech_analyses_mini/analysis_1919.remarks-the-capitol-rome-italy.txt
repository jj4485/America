In the speech, America is referenced in several ways that highlight its values, ideals, and relationship with Rome and Italy:

1. **Representation**: The speaker identifies himself as a representative of the American people, suggesting that his honor in being recognized as a citizen of Rome also reflects the values and ideals of the nation he comes from.

2. **Partnership**: The speaker expresses joy in the partnership between the Italian and American peoples, emphasizing that it is a new collaboration aimed at a common goal—freedom and liberty. This partnership symbolizes a shared commitment to democratic values and self-governance.

3. **Health of Liberty**: The speaker speaks about the pursuit of liberty, indicating that this is a fundamental principle valued by Americans. He contrasts the "mirage" of liberty that men chase with the reality of the progress that has been made in the present age, suggesting that America embodies this pursuit more clearly than ever.

4. **Highlighting Core Values**: The speaker articulates the belief that true conquest comes not through force (as seen with the Central Empires) but through trade, friendship, and service—principles that strongly resonate with American ideals of diplomacy and cooperation.

5. **Encouragement of Unity**: The speaker appeals for unity among men from different backgrounds, emphasizing that local interests should be set aside for the “great enterprise” of liberty—another highlight of American values that encourage the collective pursuit of freedom across nations.

Overall, the references to America convey a sense of pride in its foundational commitment to liberty, the value of international partnerships, and the importance of fostering cooperation among nations for the common good.
