In the speech excerpt, the president addresses several key issues concerning American governance, law enforcement, trade, and immigration, which collectively reflect on the state of America during that time. Here are some specific references to America:

1. **State Sovereignty and Law Enforcement**: The president emphasizes the importance of state laws in combating crime, particularly racketeering and corruption. He argues that every state has sufficient laws to address these issues and stresses the need for better enforcement rather than more federal laws. This reference underscores the principle of federalism in America, highlighting the balance of power and responsibilities between state and federal governments.

2. **Local Government Responsibility**: The speech points out the failure of local governments to protect citizens from various crimes. By calling for an awakening and rallying support for local law enforcement, it suggests a vision for a more capable and resilient American community that can deal with crime effectively at the local level.

3. **Trade Relations**: In discussing trade with Russia, the president clarifies that the regulations about convict labor do not constitute a trade war with any nation, including Russia. This reflects America's ongoing involvement in international trade and diplomacy and indicates a desire to maintain constructive relationships with other countries.

4. **Immigration Policy**: The president agrees with the need for revision of immigration laws to make them more selective and flexible. He provides statistics that illustrate the impact of previous policy changes on immigration rates, reflecting the American context of balancing open immigration policies with economic realities, particularly during a time of economic hardship in the early 1930s.

5. **Economic Context**: The emphasis on preventing public charges due to unemployment speaks to the economic struggles of the Great Depression era, which was affecting American society deeply at that time. This acknowledgment of economic challenges highlights the president's awareness of the socio-economic landscape of America.

Overall, the speech references America through its discussions on governance, law enforcement, international relations, and social policies, all framed within the context of responsiveness to the needs and realities facing the nation during that period.
