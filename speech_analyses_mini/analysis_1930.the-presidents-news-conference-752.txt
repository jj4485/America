The speech excerpt references America indirectly through the appointment of Mr. Charles B. Rugg as Assistant Attorney General. This appointment signifies the functioning of the American political system, specifically the executive branch, and the importance of legal appointments in the U.S. government. The mention of Mr. Rugg as the son of the chief justice of Massachusetts also highlights the connection between family legacies and public service in American governance. While the speech doesn't explicitly discuss broader American themes or issues, it reflects the governance and judiciary aspects of the United States during that time.
