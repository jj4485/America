The speech excerpt references America indirectly by emphasizing the idea of statehood and citizenship within the context of the United States. By highlighting Colorado's potential to become "one of the greatest states of the Union," the speaker positions Colorado within the larger framework of American identity and progress. The remarks about the importance of public schools and the training of the next generation speak to central American values, such as education and civic responsibility.

Additionally, the mention of various aspects of Colorado's economy—mines, irrigation works, and stock ranches—reflects broader themes in American history, particularly the westward expansion and development of natural resources. The speaker’s focus on the “real crop” being children underscores the American belief in opportunity and the future, suggesting that the success of the state—and by extension, the nation—depends on the upbringing and proper education of its youth. Thus, while the speech does not explicitly mention America, it embodies ideals and aspirations that are deeply woven into the American narrative.
