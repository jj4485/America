In the speech excerpt from 1929, there are two main references to America: 

1. **Appointment of General Graham Everson**: The mention of General Graham Everson being appointed as head of the National Guard Bureau highlights a domestic aspect of governance within the United States. The National Guard is a key component of America's military structure, and this appointment emphasizes the government's focus on national defense and the importance of the National Guard in American society.

2. **Oil Discussions**: The President's remarks about potential discussions with British Prime Minister J. Ramsay MacDonald on oil conservation suggest an awareness of international relations and the implications of energy resources on American interests. Although the President indicates that he is not prepared for such discussions, the topic of oil is relevant to American economic and strategic considerations, particularly in the context of the 1920s when oil was becoming increasingly crucial for the nation's industry and military.

Overall, the speech reflects on American governance and policy-making within the context of both domestic and international matters during that time.
