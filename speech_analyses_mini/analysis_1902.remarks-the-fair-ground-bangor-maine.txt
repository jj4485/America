The speech excerpt reflects on America and its values in several key ways:

1. **American Spirit and Identity**: The speaker emphasizes that the "old American spirit" and the habits of thought characteristic of the nation are most vividly found in the rural areas. This suggests a deep-rooted belief in the values traditionally associated with America's agrarian past.

2. **Influence of Rural Life**: The speaker highlights how many great American leaders, including Presidents, have come from rural backgrounds and have benefited from the "healthy democracy of farm life." This connection underscores the significance of rural life as a foundation for American leadership and character.

3. **Self-Reliance and Individualism**: The speech touches upon themes of self-help, individual initiative, and the rugged independence typical of American identity. These qualities are portrayed as essential to the American ethos, particularly in relation to the work ethic found among farmers and rural residents.

4. **Community and Brotherhood**: The speaker emphasizes the sense of community and brotherhood found in rural areas, suggesting that American values thrive in environments where individuals are more interconnected and supportive of one another. This contrasts with the more isolated and less communal nature of urban life.

5. **Duty and Citizenship**: The notion of duty—both to oneself and to one's neighbor—is presented as a crucial aspect of good citizenship, which is a foundational principle in American democracy. The speaker underscores that everyone, regardless of wealth or status, has responsibilities to their community.

6. **Moral and Material Progress**: The speech critiques the undue emphasis on materialism and wealth in American society while arguing for the superiority of moral values. It suggests that American progress should not just be measured by material wealth but also by the moral character of its citizens, which is essential for the health of democracy.

7. **Critique of Social Issues**: The reference to social problems and the need for thoughtful solutions highlights the ongoing challenges in American society. The speaker acknowledges that issues exist in both rural and urban settings, advocating for a shared human experience and mutual aid as part of the American spirit.

Overall, the speech intertwines American identity, values, and responsibilities, reflecting a vision of a nation where moral integrity and community support are as important as economic and material success.
