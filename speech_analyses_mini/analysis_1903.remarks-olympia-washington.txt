The speech excerpt makes several references to America and American ideals:

1. **Historical Context**: The mention of "the men who fought in the great war" evokes a sense of American patriotism and the values associated with sacrifice and bravery in warfare. This aligns with the broader narrative of American expansion and military involvement, particularly around the time of the Spanish-American War and the subsequent Philippine-American War, where figures such as Emilio Aguinaldo became significant in the context of American imperialism.

2. **Expansionism**: The speaker identifies the audience as "expansionists," linking them to the notion of American expansionism, which was a significant part of the U.S. ethos at that time. This reflects the belief in Manifest Destiny, the idea that Americans were destined to expand across the continent and beyond, influencing the politics and culture of regions like the Philippines.

3. **Pride in Accomplishments**: The reference to Washington's agriculture, lumber, and mines showcases the economic development and resources of the United States. This pride in local accomplishments can be seen as a microcosm of American exceptionalism, the belief that the U.S. has a unique mission to lead and prosper.

4. **Focus on Children**: The statement about being "most of all upon its crop of children" emphasizes the future generation, a key aspect of American values regarding hope, progress, and investment in the youth. It suggests that the prosperity and ideals of America are carried forward through its children.

Overall, the speech reinforces themes of patriotism, American expansionism, pride in national accomplishments, and a hopeful outlook for future generations, all of which are central to the American identity.
