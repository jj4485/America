The speech excerpt references America in several key ways:

1. **Statehood**: The speaker discusses the transition of the Muskogee Indian Territory to statehood within the framework of the United States. This indicates a broader context of American governance and the importance of being part of the Union. The notion of becoming one of the great states reflects a vision of growth and integration into the national landscape.

2. **Responsibility and Self-Government**: The speaker emphasizes the responsibility that comes with statehood, which is a core principle of American democracy. The idea that successful self-government relies on the quality of citizenship speaks to American values regarding individual responsibility and civic duty.

3. **Quality of Citizenship**: The speech highlights the qualities necessary for good citizenship—such as decency, integrity, and accountability—in the context of American society. This aligns with the American ideal where democracy is sustained by the character and ethics of its citizens.

4. **Public Life and Representation**: The call for honest representation and the rejection of corruption directly ties to American political ideals. The emphasis on having good neighbors and citizens as a prerequisite for effective public life reflects the foundational notion that democracy works best when its leaders are upright and accountable to the people they serve.

Overall, the speech connects the broader ideals of American democracy, such as responsibility, integrity, and quality of citizenship, to the specific context of the Muskogee Indian Territory as it moves toward statehood, suggesting that these values are essential for the success of both the individual and the state within the U.S. system.
