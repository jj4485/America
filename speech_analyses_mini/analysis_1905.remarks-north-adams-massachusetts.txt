The speech excerpt makes several references to America and its future by discussing the importance of raising children who are prepared to contribute positively to the nation. Here are some key points:

1. **Future Shapers**: The speaker highlights that the children being referred to are the future men and women who will "shape the destiny of this nation." This emphasizes the idea that the upbringing and education of children directly affect the future of America.

2. **Work Ethic**: The speaker criticizes parents who do not instill a strong work ethic in their children, suggesting that this lack of training can lead to negative consequences for the nation. The assertion here is that a strong work ethic has historically contributed to America's development and prosperity.

3. **National Accomplishments**: The mention of having "accomplished anything as a nation" implies a sense of pride in America's achievements, which the speaker attributes to the character and qualities of its citizens. This reflects an understanding of national identity being linked to individual contributions.

4. **Qualities for Civilization**: The speaker draws a parallel between the qualities needed in the military (“army and the navy”) and those needed for building a successful civilization. This equates military virtues with civic virtues, suggesting that these qualities are essential for both national defense and societal progress.

Overall, the speech emphasizes the relationship between children’s upbringing and the future state of America, framing the development of a strong work ethic in the youth as crucial for the success and values of the nation.
