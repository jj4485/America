The speech excerpt references America in several ways, particularly by embodying the casual, informal communication style typical of American leaders during that time. The President's remarks about Christmas reflect cultural traditions associated with the holiday season in America, such as preparing for family gatherings and exchanging gifts. Mentioning Christmas plans and the arrival of turkeys evokes the American customs surrounding Thanksgiving and Christmas, highlighting the sociocultural context of the era.

Additionally, the casual mention of not having any specific plans and wishing the press a merry Christmas and a happy new year emphasizes a sense of American democratic accessibility, where the President engages directly with journalists and wishes them well. The mention of "the house" preparing for the season may also reference the White House as a symbol of American governance, linking the holiday spirit to the nation's leadership. Overall, the excerpt reflects American values of informality, family, and holiday customs that were prevalent in the 1920s.
