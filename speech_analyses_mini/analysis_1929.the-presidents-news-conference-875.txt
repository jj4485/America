The speech excerpt primarily addresses the topic of tariff policy, specifically the flexible tariff, and reflects the President's views on the relationship between the Executive branch and Congress in legislative processes. While it doesn't explicitly mention America or its citizens directly, it does imply several aspects related to America:

1. **Economic Policy**: The discussion of tariffs is inherently about the American economy. Tariffs affect trade, industry, and ultimately the livelihoods of American citizens. By focusing on tariff principles, the President is addressing a matter of significant importance to the economic well-being of the country.

2. **Governance and Democratic Process**: The President emphasizes the separation of powers and the need for collaboration between the Executive and Congress. This reference highlights America's democratic framework and the checks and balances that exist within the government. It indicates that legislative decisions regarding tariffs are not solely up to the Executive but require broader discussion and consensus, reflecting American democratic ideals.

3. **Public Interest**: The President mentions that his considerations are based on principles of public interest, suggesting that policies will be designed with the welfare of American citizens in mind. This underscores a commitment to ensuring that legislation benefits the country as a whole.

4. **Background Context**: The mention of the "background in that matter" and the need for thorough hearings and fact determination suggests a careful approach to governance that values informed decision-making, which is a foundational aspect of American political philosophy.

In summary, while the speech does not mention America explicitly, it references the nation's economic interests, principles of governance, and public welfare, all of which are integral to understanding America's political and economic landscape during that time.
