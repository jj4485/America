The speech excerpt references America in several key ways:

1. **Economic Context**: The President discusses the challenges faced by American farmers due to the oversupply of wheat and the need to prepare for a larger crop. This reflects the economic conditions affecting American agriculture and the railway system's role in facilitating the export of agricultural products.

2. **Cooperation with Railways**: The President mentions efforts to reduce railway rates as part of a cooperative initiative to address the issue of agricultural storage and export. This indicates a focus on American infrastructure and its impact on the economy, emphasizing the government's role in facilitating trade within the United States.

3. **Disarmament Stance**: The discussion of the Geneva Conference highlights America's position in international relations, particularly regarding disarmament. The President emphasizes that the U.S. has already made significant reductions in military strength compared to likely reductions in Europe. This indicates America’s strategic military posture and its approach to international arms control discussions.

4. **Isolation from European Contentions**: The President states that the U.S. has chosen to withdraw from expressing opinions on technical questions that specifically concern European countries. This reflects a conscious decision to maintain a distinct American position and not to be drawn into European debates about military strength, thereby asserting American independence in its foreign policy.

5. **Commitment to Disarmament**: Despite distancing itself from European discussions, the President reaffirms America's commitment to addressing the reduction of armament on a global scale. This underscores the U.S. role as a significant player in international disarmament efforts.

Overall, the speech references America through its economic challenges, infrastructure concerns, foreign policy positions, and military strategies, illustrating how domestic issues and international relations intersect in shaping the American narrative at that time.
