The excerpt from the speech, which appears to be delivered by Abraham Lincoln, references America in several key ways:

1. **Unity of the States**: The speaker emphasizes caring for "the good people of all the States," indicating a vision of unity amidst the Civil War. By mentioning that he was born in Kentucky, raised in Indiana, and lived in Illinois, the speaker highlights the interconnectedness of different states and suggests a broader national identity.

2. **War and Freedom**: The speaker discusses the ongoing Civil War and the moral implications of slavery. He states that all men should be free and critiques the idea of enslaving African Americans, suggesting that they should not be made to fight for their oppressors. This reflects a foundational American ideal of liberty and freedom.

3. **African American Soldiers**: The speech addresses the controversial issue of employing African Americans in the military. The speaker acknowledges the practical considerations of using these individuals in the war effort while questioning the morality and logic of forcing people to fight for the system that oppresses them. This speaks to the evolving understanding of citizenship and rights in America during this period.

4. **Resources and Resilience**: The mention of "seeing the bottom of the enemy's resources" underscores the conflict between the North and South, suggesting not just a military struggle but also a trial of ideas about equality and freedom in America. It reflects the broader American struggle during the Civil War.

5. **Hope for Resolution**: The speaker expresses hope for the near end of the conflict, indicating a desire for peace and reunification in a divided nation. This aligns with the American aspiration for a more perfect union, free from the divisiveness of slavery.

Overall, the speech articulates themes of unity, freedom, equality, and the moral challenges faced in the context of the American Civil War, encapsulating fundamental issues that would shape the nation's future.
