The excerpt from the speech references America in several ways:

1. **Federalism and Interstate Relations**: The speech discusses the Colorado River Compact, which involves cooperation between seven states in the American West. This reflects the principles of federalism, where states work together to resolve common issues without solely relying on federal intervention. It highlights the importance of state collaboration and governance within the framework of the U.S. Constitution.

2. **Regional Challenges**: The mention of "quarrels" and disputes among states concerning water rights underscores the regional challenges in America. The Colorado River Basin is a vital resource, and the compact is a significant step in settling long-standing issues related to water distribution, crucial for states' agricultural and urban needs.

3. **Budget Considerations**: The discussion of the federal budget indicates the government's fiscal policies and priorities. The reference to planned expenditures and the need for budgetary considerations links to American governance and the challenges faced by public administration in balancing various needs, such as naval programs and agricultural relief, against available resources.

4. **Historical Context**: The compact’s historical significance, being the first major agreement among multiple states since the founding of the United States, reflects on the evolution of American governance and legal frameworks. It indicates how states have used constitutional provisions to collaborate on issues that affect their shared interests.

5. **Hope for Resolution**: The hope expressed for Arizona and California to resolve their issues points to the American spirit of compromise and the belief in finding solutions through dialogue and cooperation, embodying a key aspect of American governance and civic culture.

Overall, the speech places emphasis on the role of states within the American federal system, the significance of regional cooperation, the challenges of governance, and the historical context of compromise and collaboration that shapes America's political landscape.
