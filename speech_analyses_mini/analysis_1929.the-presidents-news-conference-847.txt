The excerpt from the speech references America primarily through the appointment of representatives to attend an important international celebration—the 1,000th anniversary of the Althing in Iceland. The commission, which includes prominent American figures such as a U.S. Senator (Peter Norbeck) and a Congressman (O.B. Burtness), serves to symbolize America's diplomatic engagement and participation in global events. This suggests a recognition of historical ties and cultural significance between the United States and Iceland, as well as a commitment to international relations.

Additionally, the mention of an appointment to the Department of Justice indicates the operations of the American federal government, further emphasizing the administration's functions and the governance system in the United States. By discussing these appointments and the role of government officials, the speech highlights the political structure and bureaucracy that are intrinsic to American governance. Overall, the speech underscores America's involvement in international affairs and the importance of governmental roles within the context of public service.
