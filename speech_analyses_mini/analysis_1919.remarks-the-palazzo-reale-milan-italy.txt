In the speech excerpt, America is referenced through the speaker's acknowledgment of representing the Nation. The speaker expresses gratitude for the warm welcome received from the people of Milan and suggests that their greeting is not only a personal welcome but also an expression of friendship towards the United States. The mention of "the Nation that I represent" indicates that the speaker is a representative of America and is there to promote values such as peace, fairness, and trust among nations.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of small nations treating each other fairly and building confidence, which reflects the ideals of international cooperation that America sought to promote after World War I. The reference to working together for a "great peace" can also be seen as a direct connection to America's role in shaping post-war peace agreements and fostering international relations. Thus, America is represented as a proponent of peace and collaboration among nations.
