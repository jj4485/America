This speech excerpt references America by discussing the challenges faced by the Federal prison system in the context of increasing crime and the need for reform. The President highlights specific issues such as overcrowding in prisons—mentioning that the Atlanta prison is operating at 120 percent capacity and Leavenworth at 87 percent. 

The speech addresses the broader implications of these issues for American society, specifically pointing to rising crime rates and specific categories of offenders, such as violators of the Narcotics Act and prohibition-related offenses, which are directly tied to social problems within the country. Additionally, the mention of discussions with the Attorney General and the Director of Prisons emphasizes the government's role in addressing these issues at a national level, reflecting a commitment to improving the criminal justice system in America.

Furthermore, the proposed federal actions, including seeking authority and appropriations from Congress for prison reform and increasing the number of probation officers, indicate a systematic response to challenges that, in turn, reflect the administration’s concern for public safety and effective governance within the framework of American law and social order. The President's intent to address the situation directly underscores a proactive approach to dealing with the realities of American crime and justice at the time.
