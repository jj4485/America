The excerpt from the speech references America in a couple of key ways:

1. **Collaboration with Farm Organizations**: The President emphasizes working closely with "the farm organizations in the country" to develop the membership of the Federal Farm Board. This highlights a focus on American agricultural interests and the involvement of local farmers in the governance process, reflecting the importance of agriculture in the American economy and society.

2. **Representation and Credibility**: By mentioning that the selected board members have been endorsed by significant farm organizations that represent "very large bodies of farmers," the President underscores the democratic process and representation of farmers' interests in America. This shows a conscious effort to ensure that the voices of those who are crucial to the agricultural sector are heard and considered in government decisions.

The overall context of the speech is about governance and appointments in the United States, specifically focused on agricultural policy, illustrating the connection between government actions and the needs of American citizens involved in farming.
