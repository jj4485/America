1. **Unity and National Identity**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of viewing all citizens as "fellow-citizens and fellowmen," suggesting that political affiliations (Republicans or Democrats) should take a back seat to the shared interests of the country. This call for unity indicates a desire for a cohesive national identity beyond partisan divides.

2. **Rights and Protections**: The address discusses the protection of all citizens' constitutional rights, highlighting an underlying principle of American democracy that pertains to the safeguarding of individual liberties. The speaker mentions the moral obligation of the government to ensure that rights granted through emancipation are upheld.

3. **Republican Principles**: The speaker invokes American ideals by referencing the Constitution and the importance of local self-government, which reflects the nation's foundational governance structure. The mention of the “letter and the spirit of the Constitution” indicates a commitment to the principles that define America.

4. **Historical Context**: The speaker alludes to the considerable changes resulting from the Civil War and the emancipation of formerly enslaved people, framing these historical developments as integral to the ongoing evolution of American society.

The speech references America in several key ways:

1. **Historical Context**: The speaker reflects on a significant moment in the country's history where, for the first time, the process of counting electoral votes and settling disputes was referred to a tribunal established by law. This emphasizes the rule of law and the unique democratic principles that govern the United States.

2. **Tribunal Composition**: The mention of the tribunal being composed of individuals with integrity and intelligence, chosen from both political parties, highlights the American values of fairness, bipartisanship, and the importance of a just judicial process in resolving political disputes.

This reflects a core tenet of American democracy where the populace places trust in established legal frameworks.

This is a reflection of the American ideal that democratic transitions of power should be conducted in a peaceful manner, reflecting the stability and resilience of American governance.

The emphasis on unity, justice, and peace speaks to the overarching mission of the American government to ensure the welfare of its citizens and maintain harmony among diverse political views.
