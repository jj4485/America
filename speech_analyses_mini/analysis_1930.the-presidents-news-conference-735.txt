The speech excerpt references America in the context of federalism, specifically the relationship between federal and state authorities regarding law enforcement and prohibition. The President emphasizes that the federal government does not intend to overstep its boundaries or assume the responsibilities traditionally held by the states. Instead, any proposed solutions aim to enhance the federal government's administrative capabilities without diminishing the role of state governments. This reflects the American system of government, where power is divided between national and state authorities, and highlights the ongoing conversation about the balance of these responsibilities within the context of prohibition enforcement.
