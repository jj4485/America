The speech references America in several ways, primarily through its emphasis on shared values, duty, and a collective history that transcends regional divides. Here are some specific points where the concept of America is invoked:

1. **Pride in Heritage**: The speaker expresses pride in their Southern heritage while also acknowledging their mixed Northern and Southern lineage: "It has been my very great good fortune to have the right to claim that my blood is half Southern and half Northern." This highlights a broader American identity that encompasses diverse regional backgrounds.

2. **Valor and Duty**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of duty and valor among all Americans, regardless of which side they fought for during the Civil War: "All Americans who are worthy of the name feel an equal pride in the valor of those who fought on one side or the other." This call for unity in acknowledging the sacrifices of both sides appeals to the American ideal of valuing patriotism and service.

3. **Learning from the Past**: The speaker recounts stories from their family's history to illustrate the values and qualities that shape good citizens: "I can understand why the boys and girls of Roswell of that time grew up to be men and women who were good servants of the community." This underlines a fundamental aspect of American identity—growing and learning from historical experiences to become responsible citizens.

4. **Community and Neighborliness**: The speaker reflects on the importance of neighborly relationships and community ties, suggesting that these are foundational to American life: "All those stories of the life of those days taught me what a real home life, a real neighbor life was and should be." This highlights the value placed on community, which is a significant aspect of American society.

5. **Recognition of Shared Experiences**: The acknowledgment of common experiences, such as those during the Civil War, where individuals on both sides acted with honor and duty, promotes a sense of collective American identity: "Men and women, don't you think that I have the ancestral right to claim a proud kinship with those who showed their devotion to duty as they saw the duty, whether they wore the gray or whether they wore the blue?" This reflects the idea that American identity is shaped not just by conflict but by the shared values that come from overcoming those conflicts together.

Overall, the speech essentially reinforces themes of unity, service, and pride in American history and identity, transcending the divides of geography and conflict.
