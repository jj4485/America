The speech references America in several significant ways, emphasizing its ideals, responsibilities, and role in the world:

1. **Service to Humanity*: The speaker emphasizes that the purpose of the American military, particularly the Navy, is to serve humanity rather than to conquer. This notion reflects a core American ideal of promoting liberty and democracy rather than engaging in aggressive military actions.

2. **Symbolism of the American Flag*: The speaker draws a powerful connection between the American flag and the historical struggle for liberty, interpreting the flag as a "floating charter" representing rights and sacrifices made for freedom. This symbolism serves to reinforce the moral and ethical responsibilities of those serving in the military.

3. **Championing the People*: The address reminds the graduates that they are not just serving a government but the people of the United States. This underscores the idea that their duties are directly tied to the welfare and rights of fellow citizens, reinforcing a sense of accountability and purpose.

4. **Education and Growth*: The speaker encourages the graduates to view their education as ongoing and to remain "ready and fit" to take on their duties. This reflects the American spirit of continuous improvement and responsibility.

5. **Moral Leadership*: There is a call for the graduates to demonstrate moral leadership and self-control in their interactions both at home and abroad. The speaker highlights the notion that America is expected to act as a leader in promoting peace and welfare rather than merely using military force.

6. **Explorers of New Paths*: The challenge to the graduates to be "explorers" who carry forth the American spirit into the world implies that they are tasked with spreading American values and ideals globally, further solidifying America's role on the international stage.

7. **Collective Responsibility*: The speaker invites the graduates to think of themselves as representatives of a greater American identity, highlighting their role in shaping how America is perceived around the world and encouraging them to uphold the nation's ideals.

In summary, the speech serves as a reflection on the moral and civic responsibilities of American military leaders, framing their service as part of a broader mission to uphold and propagate the values that America stands for.
