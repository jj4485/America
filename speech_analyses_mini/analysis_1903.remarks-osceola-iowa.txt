The speech excerpt refers to America indirectly through the themes of governance, legislation, and the management of corporate power, which are central to the American political landscape. The speaker emphasizes the importance of "wise supervision and regulation" of corporations, specifically trusts engaged in interstate business, reflecting a concern with the balance of power in the American economy and the role of the government in regulating that power to protect the public interest.

Moreover, the speaker acknowledges the contributions of local Iowa politicians, highlighting a sense of collective effort and representing an example of grassroots participation in American democracy. The mention of fulfilling promises made during political campaigns ties into the broader American values of integrity and accountability in public office.

Additionally, the call for improved legislation and the enforcement of laws with "honesty and fearlessness" speaks to a vision of a fair and just society, which is foundational to American ideals. Overall, while the speech does not explicitly mention "America," it embodies key principles and concerns that shape the American political and social ethos.
