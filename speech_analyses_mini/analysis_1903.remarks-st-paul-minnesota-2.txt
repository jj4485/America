The speech excerpt references America in several significant ways:

1. **Representation of the People**: The speaker emphasizes that the President stands as a representative of the people, not just a specific party or creed. This underscores the democratic principle that America is defined by its citizens and their unity rather than divisions.

2. **Symbolism of the State**: The speaker describes Minnesota as being "in the heart of the country" and "typifies all that is most American." This highlights Minnesota's role as a microcosm of the broader American experience, suggesting that it embodies key American values and characteristics.

3. **Historical Reference**: The mention of the flags from the Civil War, particularly the First Minnesota regiment and its valor at Gettysburg, speaks to a pivotal moment in American history. The reference to the bravery and sacrifices made by soldiers reinforces themes of patriotism and national identity.

4. **Diversity and Unity**: The speaker acknowledges the "many different race strains in the Northwest," particularly in Minnesota, and suggests that this diversity contributes to a proud, uniquely American identity. This recognition of a melting pot of cultures aligns with the idea of America as a land of immigrants and varied backgrounds.

5. **Pride in American Character**: The description of Minnesotans as having "robust strength" and a willingness "to do alike in peace and in war" evokes a sense of pride in American resilience and patriotism, framing the citizens as embodying core American values.

6. **Inclusiveness**: By expressing gladness to see men, women, and children, the speaker underscores the importance of community and the inclusion of all citizens in the American narrative.

Overall, the speech weaves together themes of representation, historical significance, diversity, and pride in American identity, creating a cohesive vision of what it means to be American.
