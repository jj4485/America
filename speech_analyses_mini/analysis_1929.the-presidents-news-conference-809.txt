The speech excerpt refers to America in several ways:

1. **Government Actions and Agreements**: The President mentions the Young reparations agreement and emphasizes that the U.S. government is not a party to it, highlighting a level of autonomy in foreign policy. This reference shows how America's decisions regarding international agreements are handled at a governmental level without necessarily needing congressional approval, reflecting the distinct role of the executive branch.

2. **Law Enforcement and Border Issues**: The President expresses concern over incidents at the Canadian border related to Prohibition enforcement, indicating the challenges America faced during this period concerning illegal activities and the misuse of arms. The emphasis on lawful conduct and community cooperation underscores the administration's commitment to upholding American laws and protecting domestic interests.

3. **Regulation of Railroads**: The statement about the Interstate Commerce Commission as an independent agency highlights the system of checks and balances within the American government. It exemplifies how transportation and commerce are regulated in the U.S., which directly impacts American infrastructure and economy.

4. **Infrastructure Development**: The mention of the Interoceanic Canal Board and the surveys for the Nicaragua Canal relates to American interests in infrastructure development that would potentially enhance trade and connectivity, further indicating the U.S.'s involvement in significant international projects during that era.

Overall, the excerpt illustrates the President's concerns and actions related to domestic law enforcement, regulatory independence, foreign agreements, and infrastructure projects—all of which are crucial aspects of governance and policy in America at that time.
