The speech excerpt references America primarily in the context of the President's actions and decisions that impact the nation, such as sending a message to Congress about the situation in Haiti. This suggests that the U.S. government's involvement in Haiti is a matter of national interest, possibly indicating concerns about stability, diplomatic relations, or humanitarian issues.

Additionally, the mention of the appointment of Colonel Hurley as Secretary of War reflects the President's efforts to create a representative Cabinet that acknowledges the interests of various regions in the U.S., specifically the Southern States. This not only addresses regional representation but also highlights the government's response to the desires of different constituencies within America.

Furthermore, the discussion of organizing industries through the Chamber of Commerce and the coordination of public works by the Department of Commerce signifies efforts to bolster the American economy during a critical time, hinting at economic recovery initiatives in response to the challenges America faced at the time, especially in the context of the Great Depression.

Overall, the speech illustrates the President's focus on national governance, regional representation, and economic organization, all of which are essential themes in American political discourse.
