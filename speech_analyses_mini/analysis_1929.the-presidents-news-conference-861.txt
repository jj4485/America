In this speech excerpt, the reference to America is implicit in several contexts, particularly regarding national interest and government support for emerging industries. Here are key points:

1. **National Routes**: The President discusses the identification of "positive national routes" for airmail and shipping. This indicates a focus on routes that are vital for the country's connectivity and economic development, highlighting the government’s role in establishing essential infrastructure for its citizens.

2. **Government Support**: The mention of a "definite element of subsidy on the part of the Government" underlines the U.S. government's commitment to developing its airmail service and aviation industry. This support reflects a broader strategy to invest in national progress, showcasing an active role in fostering economic growth through transportation.

3. **Interagency Collaboration**: The involvement of multiple departments and the Shipping Board in addressing these transportation challenges signifies a coordinated effort by the U.S. government to unify various sectors—commerce, military (Army and Navy), and postal services—for the benefit of the nation as a whole.

4. **Merchant Marine and Economic Development**: The speech draws parallels between airmail and merchant marine services. The intent to improve these services by analyzing trade routes and contractual support reflects a vision for strengthening America's economic framework and global competitiveness.

Overall, while the speech does not overtly assert the concept of "America," it implicitly emphasizes national development, government responsibility, and the connection between infrastructure and economic vitality, all of which are central themes related to American interests.
