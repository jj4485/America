The excerpt you provided appears to reference General William Tecumseh Sherman and his military campaigns during the American Civil War, specifically mentioning his incursions into Atlanta and Savannah. These cities were significant battlegrounds in the war, and Sherman's military actions, especially his "March to the Sea," were pivotal in the Union's efforts to defeat the Confederacy.

The mention of "three cheers for his coming out gloriously" suggests a celebration of Sherman’s successes, which would be viewed as victories for the Union and, therefore, for the United States as a whole. The context implies a rallying of support for the Union cause and an affirmation of hope for the preservation and unity of the nation. By celebrating Sherman's successes, the speech indirectly references the broader struggle for the preservation of the United States during a tumultuous period in its history.
