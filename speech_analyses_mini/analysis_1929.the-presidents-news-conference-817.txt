The excerpt from the speech references America in a few key ways:

1. **Law Enforcement and Judicial Reference**: The President discusses Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, who is a member of the Supreme Court, indicating the involvement of the highest judiciary in American law enforcement efforts. This reflects the American governance structure and the importance of law to society.

2. **Emergency Appropriation for Agricultural Protection**: The mention of the Mediterranean fruit fly and the request for a $4 million emergency appropriation from Congress to combat it emphasizes the government's role in protecting American agriculture and horticulture. The statement highlights the significance of agricultural safety and pest control as national concerns in America.

3. **National Challenges**: By stating that the Mediterranean fruit fly is "probably the greatest menace that could come into American horticulture," the President directly connects the issue to the well-being of the agricultural sector in the country, thus framing it as a matter of national importance.

Overall, the speech reflects concerns about law, national security (in terms of agriculture), and governance, all of which tie back to the well-being and organization of American society.
