The speech references America in several key ways:

1. **Connection with Citizens**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of being in touch with the feelings and desires of the American people. By expressing delight at the welcome from the citizens of Ogden, Utah, the speaker establishes a connection to the local populace and underscores the speaker's commitment to representing American interests.

2. **Heartfelt Theme**: The speech discusses the theme of the League of Nations and the peace treaty, portraying these issues as central to the American public's concerns. The speaker believes that a significant majority (80%) of Americans support the League, reflecting the collective sentiment of the citizenry and highlighting a sense of unity among the people regarding international cooperation.

3. **Distinction from Disloyal Elements**: The speaker contrasts the loyalty of the American people with the opposition to the League, attributing that opposition to disloyal elements. This distinction serves to reinforce a patriotic narrative that aligns true American values with support for international collaboration and peace.

4. **Collective Purpose**: The speech frames the promotion of the League of Nations not only as a political decision but as an imperative for fulfilling the sacrifices made by American soldiers during World War I. By saying that "we are going to see that the thing they fought for is accomplished," the speaker invokes the shared American identity and responsibility to honor those who served.

5. **Critique of Isolation**: The speaker warns against isolationism, suggesting that rejecting the League would align the U.S. with Germany's intentions to separate America from its allies. This highlights the importance of America maintaining its role in the international community and cooperating with other nations to ensure peace.

Overall, the speech reflects a deep concern for America's involvement in global affairs, a commitment to the democratic values represented by the League of Nations, and a call for unity among Americans to secure a lasting peace following the war.
