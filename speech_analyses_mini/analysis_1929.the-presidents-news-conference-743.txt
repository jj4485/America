The excerpt from the President's news conference in 1929 touches upon several aspects that reference America, primarily through its focus on agricultural issues and government expenditure, which are central to the nation's economy and policy at the time.

1. **Government Expenditures:** The mention of "phases of Government expenditure" reflects the President’s awareness of fiscal policy, which is crucial for a nation like the United States. During this period, public spending decisions were significant for the economic climate and for responding to the needs of the American population, particularly in the context of the Great Depression that was just beginning.

2. **Federal Farm Board:** The President discusses the Federal Farm Board, indicating the government's involvement in agricultural matters, which is vital for many Americans, especially farmers. The mention of "organized wheat pools" and "farmer-owned and farmer-controlled elevators" highlights the importance of cooperative efforts among American farmers, showing how agricultural policy affects rural communities and the nation’s food supply.

3. **Regional Representation:** The reference to the search for a Western member of the Farm Board suggests the need for representation of diverse agricultural interests across the country. This reflects America's vast geographic and cultural landscape, where different regions have distinct agricultural commodities and practices.

4. **Cooperative Marketing:** The speech addresses the complexities of cooperative marketing among different farmer groups, indicating the grassroots efforts that characterize American agricultural practices. It highlights the tension and collaboration required among various stakeholders to ensure that farmers, a significant sector of the American economy, can effectively market their goods.

Overall, the speech references America through its economic concerns, agricultural policies, and the importance of cooperative efforts among its citizens, reflecting the broader national context of the time.
