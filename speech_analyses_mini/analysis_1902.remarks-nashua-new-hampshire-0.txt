The speech excerpt references America in several ways:

1. **Industrial Growth**: The speaker emphasizes the "extraordinary industrial progress" of the country, indicating how the United States has developed economically and industrially over the past fifty years. This highlights the broader context of America's rapid industrialization during that era.

2. **Geographical Expansion**: The mention of "expansion westward across the continent to the Pacific" refers to a significant historical period in American history, reflecting the notion of Manifest Destiny and the country's territorial growth. It sets the stage for understanding the economic and cultural development of America.

3. **Prosperity**: The speaker acknowledges that the prosperity of cities like Nashua is tied to the prosperity of the entire country, suggesting a collective American experience of growth and success. The emphasis on prosperity as a shared national characteristic reinforces the idea of American exceptionalism.

4. **Balance of Material and Moral Values**: The speech promotes the idea that while material prosperity is important, it must be complemented by moral values such as "kindly brotherhood" and "decency in public and private life." This reflects a common American belief that success should be accompanied by ethical conduct and community spirit, intertwining the ideals of the American Dream with social responsibility.

Overall, the speech captures key themes of American identity, such as industrial might, territorial expansion, collective prosperity, and the pursuit of moral values alongside material success.
