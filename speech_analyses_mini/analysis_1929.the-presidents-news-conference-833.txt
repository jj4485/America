In the excerpt from the President's news conference in 1929, there are several implicit references to America and the government's relationship with its citizens:

1. **Government Expenditures**: The President discusses the budget and government expenditures, highlighting the importance of understanding how taxpayer money is utilized for various purposes. This reflects the American democratic principle of transparency in government spending, which is essential for public accountability.

2. **Departmental Functions**: By explaining that the budget is constructed by departments and that each has regulatory functions aiding different purposes throughout the country, the President hints at the complex nature of American governance. This structure reflects the federal system of government in the U.S., where various departments work towards different public goals.

3. **Public Understanding**: The President's intention to release simplified budget information suggests a commitment to ensuring that the American public has a clearer understanding of government operations. This aligns with the democratic ideals of informing citizens and encouraging civic engagement.

4. **Timing for Release**: The mention of releasing budget details after the normal budget process implies a respect for the established governmental processes and the role they play in American democracy.

Overall, while the speech does not explicitly name America, its focus on government budgeting, transparency, and public understanding correlates with the values and operations of the American political system.
