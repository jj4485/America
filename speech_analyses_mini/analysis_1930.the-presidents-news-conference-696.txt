In the excerpt from the speech, America is referenced in several ways:

1. **Protection of Americans**: President Hoover starts by addressing concerns for Americans in Santo Domingo, explicitly stating that he has no information indicating any danger to their life or liberty amid the disturbances in the Dominican Republic. This underscores a focus on American citizens abroad and their safety, highlighting the government's responsibility to protect its citizens.

2. **Legislation and Government Expenditures**: The President discusses the need for fiscal responsibility within the context of government expenditures and initiatives that may arise from various American groups and organizations. He emphasizes that while many proposed projects are worthy, the government must be cautious and cannot undertake every initiative. This reflects the broader theme of balancing national priorities with the needs and desires of American citizens.

3. **Economic and Social Responsibility**: The speech conveys a message about the government’s fiscal limitations and the need to manage expenditures within the resources available to the government, which ultimately affects American taxpayers. By discussing budgetary constraints in relation to public works, veteran support, and social programs, Hoover connects the government’s financial decisions directly to the welfare of the American populace.

4. **Call for Support from Congress and the Public**: The President appeals to Congress members and the American public for cooperation in maintaining fiscal discipline, indicating that collective effort is necessary to manage the country's financial health. This involvement underscores the idea of shared responsibility between the government and its citizens.

Overall, the speech references America primarily through its citizens' safety, fiscal responsibility, and the government's commitment to managing resources wisely for the benefit of the nation.
