In the excerpt from the speech, America is referenced in several ways that highlight its role in the context of World War I and its broader implications for global peace and order. Here are the key points in which America is mentioned:

1. **Gratitude and Solidarity**: The speaker evokes a sense of collective gratitude toward soldiers from the United States, along with those from Great Britain, France, and Italy. This acknowledgment emphasizes America's participation in the war and shared sacrifices alongside its allies.

2. **Shared Values and Goals**: The speaker refers to the soldiers' fight not only for their nations but for a new order that seeks to overcome the old and unstable "balance of power." This vision aligns with the ideals of freedom and democracy that America embodies.

3. **Promotion of Peace**: The speaker underscores America's interest in establishing a new framework for international relations that transcends mere military alliances (the "balance of power") and hinges on cooperation among nations—a goal that America is positioned to champion.

4. **Leadership Role**: By stating that it has never been deemed excusable for a President of the United States to leave the country, the speaker emphasizes the exceptional nature of this occasion. The decision to engage directly in international diplomacy after the war illustrates America's commitment to being a leader in fostering global peace.

5. **Support from the Government**: The speaker mentions the support of colleagues in the U.S. government, showing that this mission of promoting peace and a League of Nations is backed by a consensus among American leaders.

Overall, America's role in the speech is portrayed as a proactive and collaborative force in the aftermath of World War I, committed to shaping a new global order based on cooperation and peace rather than military might.
