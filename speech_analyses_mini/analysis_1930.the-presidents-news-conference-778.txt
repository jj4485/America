The speech excerpt references America primarily through its focus on the governance and administrative practices within the District of Columbia, which is the capital of the United States. Here are a few ways it makes reference to America:

1. **Census and Reapportionment**: The mention of the Census and its role in reapportionment underlines a fundamental aspect of American democracy, where population counts influence representation in Congress. This reflects the American principles of representation and accountability in government.

2. **Executive Order and Civil Service**: The President discusses an Executive Order (EO 5491) regarding the application of Civil Service principles to future appointments in the District government. This indicates the commitment to a merit-based system in public administration, which is a critical aspect of American governance.

3. **Location – District of Columbia**: By referring specifically to the District of Columbia, the speech emphasizes the federal nature of the American government, where DC serves as the seat of national government and is distinct from individual states.

4. **Role of the Civil Service Commission**: The Civil Service Commission's agreement to implement a merit-based hiring process reflects the broader American ethos of ensuring competence and fairness in government employment, moving away from patronage systems.

5. **Legislative and Executive Dynamics**: The conversation about the need for Senate confirmation for appointments indicates the checks and balances inherent in the American political system, highlighting the separation of powers.

Overall, the speech emphasizes key elements of the American political system, including governance, representation, and the principles underlying civil service, thereby reinforcing America's democratic framework.
