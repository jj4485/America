The speech references America primarily through its focus on American veterans and the responsibilities of the government toward them. Here are a few specific ways it addresses American values and issues:

1. **Responsibility Toward Veterans**: The President emphasizes the government's obligation to provide care and support for veterans, particularly those suffering from disabilities resulting from their service. This reflects the American value of honoring and taking care of those who have served in the military.

2. **Justice and Fairness**: The speech discusses the need for justice and equity in how veterans are treated, highlighting the importance of fairness in government actions. This appeals to the American principle of equal rights and the belief that all veterans, regardless of their circumstances, deserve support.

3. **Financial Responsibility**: The President expresses concerns about the financial implications of the proposed veterans' pension bill, reflecting American values of fiscal responsibility and concern for taxpayers. He warns against legislation that may be burdensome or wasteful, which would resonate with American sentiments about prudent governance.

4. **Critique of Legislation**: The strong criticism of the proposed bill suggests that American democratic processes involve rigorous debate and the necessity of legislation that truly serves the public good. The call for comprehensive study and sensible action reflects a deliberative approach characteristic of American political discourse.

5. **Collective Support**: The statement that “the country as a whole would support” careful and just action indicates an appeal to the civic engagement and collective outlook that is often associated with American society, where legislation should align with the public's sentiments and needs.

Overall, the speech engages with themes of justice, responsibility, fairness, and fiscal prudence, all of which are central to American ideals and governance.
