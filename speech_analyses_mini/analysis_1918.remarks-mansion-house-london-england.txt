In this speech excerpt, America is referenced in the context of the speaker's journey across the ocean to participate in the peace conference, highlighting a significant act of diplomacy and engagement with international affairs. The speaker mentions Washington, indicating their role in the American government and alluding to the fact that the decision to travel to London to join the discussions was seen as breaking with traditional expectations or precedents. 

Specifically, the speaker states, "I said to members of the press in Washington one evening that one of the things that had interested me most since I lived in Washington was that every time I did anything perfectly natural it was said to be unprecedented." This points to the contrast between the expectations from the American perspective and the historical norms of diplomacy. 

The overall context suggests a pride in American involvement in world affairs, particularly in the aftermath of World War I, as the speaker expresses a commitment to international cooperation and understanding, which reflects America's emerging role as a significant player on the global stage. The mention of "the demand for intimate conference" further emphasizes the importance of dialogue and collaboration between nations, which aligns with American values of engagement and diplomacy. 

Additionally, the speaker's acknowledgment of the suffering experienced by various nations, including England, France, and Belgium, frames America as part of a broader coalition seeking peace and recovery after the war, enhancing the sentiment of camaraderie and shared purpose on the world stage.
