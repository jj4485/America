The speech excerpt alludes to themes relevant to America during the 1862 context, particularly the Civil War period. Here are some ways in which it references America:

1. **Military Leadership**: The mention of "General Scott," who was a prominent Union general during the Civil War, hints at the ongoing conflict and the importance of military leadership in American society at that time. This underscores the significance of military matters in shaping the nation during a time of crisis.

2. **Government and Politics**: The reference to the "Secretary of War" and his control over the press points to the political dynamics of the U.S. government. It highlights the relationship between military leadership, government officials, and media, reflecting the importance of communication and information in American governance during a tumultuous period.

3. **Public Perception and Communication**: The analogy of looking at birds and animals through a fog suggests that public understanding can be clouded or distorted, which can reflect on how the American public might perceive military and political events. This aligns with the broader theme of public opinion and its influence on American society and the war effort.

4. **Internal Conflicts**: The overall context of the speech implies a nation facing significant internal strife, as the Civil War was fundamentally about issues such as state rights and slavery, which were deeply woven into the fabric of American identity and politics.

While the excerpt does not provide explicit references to broader American ideals or values, it inherently draws on the historical and political context of the United States during a critical turning point in its history.
