In this speech excerpt, the President references America indirectly through his role and the context of the news conference. By stating that "there is nothing going on about this office that is of importance today," he reflects on the state of affairs in the country at that time. The mention of being "in the papers for the next week" suggests that while there may be no immediate news to report, the President is aware of the media's scrutiny and the public's interest in governmental affairs, which is a key aspect of American democracy.

Additionally, the President's casual tone and informal approach indicate an accessibility to the media, which is a characteristic of the American political system where transparency and communication between the government and its citizens are valued. The lack of important news may also reflect the broader political and social context of America during that period, signaling a moment of calm or uncertainty within the political landscape. Overall, while he does not explicitly mention America, the dynamics of the news conference and the role of the President in American society are implicit in his remarks.
