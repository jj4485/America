In the speech excerpt, America is referenced indirectly through the mention of the business situation, specifically regarding Christmas buying trends. The President discusses a report from the Department of Commerce and other agencies that indicates consumer spending during the Christmas season is at or above the average level compared to the previous year. This reflects the economic conditions in the United States at that time and suggests a level of consumer confidence and activity, which are important indicators of the overall health of the American economy. Additionally, the welcoming of the President-elect of Mexico as a distinguished guest highlights the diplomatic relationship between the United States and Mexico, which is an essential aspect of international relations for America. Overall, these references provide insight into the domestic economic climate and foreign relations, both significant elements of American policy and society during that era.
