The speech excerpt references America indirectly through its focus on the achievements and industriousness of the people in Oxnard, California, which is part of the broader American landscape. The speaker highlights the "extraordinary industry" that has developed in a relatively short period, emphasizing progress and innovation characteristic of American development during that era.

The mention of specific agricultural activities like "beet culture" and "fruit culture," as well as "irrigation" and "tilling of the soil," reflects the American spirit of innovation and self-reliance, showcasing how individuals and communities work to cultivate the land and improve their livelihoods. This emphasis on hard work and agricultural achievement is a nod to the American values of entrepreneurship and advancement.

Furthermore, the speaker's astonishment at the developments in California can be seen as a microcosm of the broader American experience of exploration, growth, and transformation, particularly in the context of the burgeoning agricultural economy in the early 20th century. Overall, while the speech does not explicitly mention "America," it embodies the themes associated with American identity, progress, and resilience.
