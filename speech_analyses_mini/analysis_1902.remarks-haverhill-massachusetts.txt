The speech prominently references America and its national identity in several ways:

1. **Collective National Interest**: The speaker emphasizes that the navy is of "vitally interested" to the entire country, indicating that national defense and maritime strength are issues that resonate with all Americans, regardless of their geographic location—be it the West, the East Coast, or elsewhere. This underlines a sense of national unity and collective responsibility among citizens.

2. **Honor and Reputation**: The speaker discusses the importance of national honor, both at home and abroad, suggesting that America must be sensitive to actions that might bring "stain on the national honor" or "disgrace to the national arms." This connects the idea of military preparedness and naval strength with the broader concept of American values and reputation on the world stage.

3. **Historical Context**: The reference to three major crises in American history (the War of 1812, the Civil War, and the Spanish-American War) situates the navy's role within the framework of American heritage. It illustrates how crucial naval power has been to the nation’s past and its ability to emerge honorably from conflicts.

4. **Democratic Values**: The speech highlights the Navy Academy at Annapolis as a "typically democratic and American school," reinforcing the notion that America values merit and equality of opportunity. This portrayal reflects the ideal that anyone, regardless of background, can serve the nation through the military if they demonstrate ability and character.

5. **Call to Action and Responsibility**: The speaker calls upon the American people to take action—advocating for continuous improvement and preparedness of the navy. This is a reflection of American values of readiness and resilience, urging citizens to remain vigilant in national defense.

6. **American Exceptionalism**: The speech suggests that it is an expectation for a nation as great as America to maintain an effective and powerful navy, aligning with the notion of American exceptionalism—the idea that the United States has a unique role and responsibility in the world.

In summary, the speech references America through its collective interest in national defense, the importance of honor, historical examples, democratic ideals, the call for vigilance and preparedness, and the notion of American exceptionalism.
