In the excerpt from the speech, the President references America indirectly through his discussion of the challenges and responsibilities of his role, which reflects the broader context of American governance and public service. Specifically, the mention of being "condemned to work this summer and stay in Washington" signifies the commitment to fulfilling presidential duties, even during times when the public may be enjoying holidays or vacations. 

Additionally, the reference to "the reparations settlement" hints at the international and economic issues that can impact America, particularly in the context of the post-World War I era and its effects on the global economy. The President's acknowledgment of nothing significant to report to the press also underscores the complexities and pressures of leadership within the American political system, indicating that, while there may be pressing issues, he feels unprepared to comment on them at that moment. Overall, the speech reflects the realities of political leadership in America during that period, including work commitments, media relations, and the gravity of decision-making.
