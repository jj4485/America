The speech excerpt references America in a few key ways:

1. **Support for the Flag**: The speaker mentions that "the American people never fail to support the flag," which symbolizes national pride and unity. This reflects a sense of patriotism and loyalty to the country.

2. **Connection to Prosperity**: The observation that "majorities rise with prosperity" suggests a relationship between the well-being of the nation and its democratic processes. This implies that as America thrives economically, its citizens are more likely to rally behind leadership and support national initiatives.

3. **Acknowledgment of Community and Citizenship**: The use of "My fellow-citizens" establishes a connection not only to the immediate audience but also emphasizes a collective identity among Americans as members of a democratic society.
