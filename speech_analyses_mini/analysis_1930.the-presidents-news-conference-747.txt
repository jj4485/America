The speech excerpt references America indirectly through its discussion of the Tariff Commission and the Power Commission, both of which are key components of American economic policy. The Tariff Commission is involved in matters related to trade and tariffs, which are crucial for regulating import and export policies that affect the American economy. Likewise, the Power Commission relates to energy governance, which is vital for infrastructure and economic growth in the United States.

Moreover, the mention of appointments and changes within these commissions suggests an emphasis on governance and leadership in addressing pressing economic and energy issues facing the nation at that time. The President's search for "inspiration" and "material" to discuss implies a need for dialogue about national interests, thereby engaging with the American public and their concerns.

Lastly, the reference to "an unpleasant reminder of pleasant things" could symbolically resonate with the American experience during the economic challenges of the 1930s, hinting at nostalgia or reflection on better times and a hope for recovery. Overall, the speech captures aspects of American governance, economic policy, and the sentiment of the era.
