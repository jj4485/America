In the excerpt from the speech, America is referenced indirectly through the context of the President's remarks regarding the Haitian Commission's report and the implications for U.S. policy in Haiti. When the President indicates that the administration will adopt the recommendations of the Haitian Commission as the basis for its policies in Haiti, it suggests American involvement and influence in Haitian affairs. This reflects the broader historical context of U.S. intervention in Haiti, particularly during the early 20th century when America had significant political and military presence in the country. The President's approval of the report indicates a commitment to shaping U.S. foreign policy in the Caribbean, which is a key aspect of America's role in the region during that era.
