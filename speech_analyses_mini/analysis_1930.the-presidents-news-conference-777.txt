In the speech excerpt, the President's reference to America can be inferred through the context of foreign policy and international relations. The mention of "our attitude toward a loan to Santo Domingo" implies that the United States (as the President of the U.S.) is discussing its role and position regarding lending or supporting a loan to the Dominican Republic (Santo Domingo being the capital). The phrase "we will not in any way obstruct Santo Domingo" indicates America's willingness to cooperate and engage positively with other nations, suggesting a diplomatic stance.

The speech reflects a certain aspect of American foreign policy at the time, where the U.S. played an influential role in the affairs of Latin American countries. The overall tone conveys a sense of responsibility and willingness to assist, highlighting the United States' involvement in international finance and its relationships with neighboring countries. This is indicative of broader themes regarding America's approach to governance and diplomacy in the early 20th century.
