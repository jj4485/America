This speech, while not explicitly mentioning "America," indirectly references the values and ideals associated with American citizenship and governance. Here are some key points that connect the speech to America:

1. **Promotion of Citizenship Qualities**: The speaker emphasizes the importance of qualities such as honesty, courage, and common sense as essential for good citizenship. These traits reflect the democratic values fundamental to American society, where the responsibility of citizenship is placed on the individual.

2. **Critique of Governance Elsewhere**: The speaker refers to other countries that, despite having similar institutions, fail to achieve the standards set by the United States. This comparison highlights the unique qualities of American citizens and their role in upholding democracy and governance.

3. **The Role of the Average Citizen**: The notion that "it is the average citizen back of the law that counts most" underscores the American ideal of civic participation, where every individual's actions contribute to the greater good of society and the functioning of government.

4. **Call for Accountability**: The message that failure to have decent government is "your own fault" suggests a theme of individual accountability, which is a cornerstone of the American democratic framework. This encourages citizens to take an active role in their governance.

5. **Emphasis on Moral Values**: The speaker's assertion that good government relies not on brilliance or genius but on moral values aligns with American ideals that prioritize ethical behavior and integrity in public service.

In summary, while the speech does not explicitly name America, it embodies the core principles of American democracy, citizenship, and the importance of individual responsibility in maintaining government and societal standards.
