The speech excerpt references America primarily through its focus on government expenditures and policies aimed at alleviating unemployment during the Great Depression. The President discusses specific financial figures, such as the $724 million allocated for construction work, which indicates a direct effort to stimulate the American economy and create jobs. This emphasis on government action reflects the broader context of the United States during the 1930s, as the nation faced significant economic challenges.

Moreover, the mention of maintaining wage scales and ensuring that government contracts adhere to the principle of paying prevailing wages illustrates the U.S. government's role in regulating labor practices and promoting fair wages. This aligns with the New Deal philosophy of economic recovery and social welfare that characterized Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration in that era.

Additionally, by addressing the complexities of funding and the impracticality of dissecting expenditures by state, the speech underscores the national scale of the government's intervention in the economy, which is a key aspect of American policy-making during times of crisis. The greeting of "merry Christmas" at the end serves to ground the conversation in the American cultural context, reinforcing a sense of community and resilience even amid economic difficulties.
