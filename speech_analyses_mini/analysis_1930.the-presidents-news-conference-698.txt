The speech excerpt references America in several ways:

1. **Census Significance**: The President emphasizes the importance of the decennial census for the entire country, which highlights its role in understanding and managing the population of the United States. The mention of "the whole of the 120 millions of people" refers specifically to the American population at that time, underscoring the scope and scale of the census as a national effort.

2. **Cooperation**: The call for cooperation from "the whole country" indicates a collective responsibility among American citizens to participate in the census. This reflects the typical democratic values of civic duty and participation in governance that are fundamental to American society.

3. **Impact on Governance and Society**: The President speaks of the "values which flow from the census taking," tying the census directly to governance and social determinations. This illustrates how the census is essential for informing government policy and resource allocation, which are key aspects of American democracy and public administration.

4. **Economic Advancement**: The reference to "economic advancement" aligns with American ideals of progress and prosperity, suggesting that accurate census data is crucial for fostering economic development and planning.

5. **Familial Reference**: The personal nature of the President's assertion about "furnishing information" as the head of the family also connects to the American value of family and individual roles within society. This highlights the importance of personal responsibility in the larger context of national governance.
