The statistics refer to trends in employment, construction, and business recovery specific to the United States.

4. **Policy Measures**: The speech outlines measures taken by U.S. authorities, including actions by the Federal Reserve System and public authorities. These references underline the American governmental framework and its active role in managing economic difficulties.

5. **Historical Comparison**: The President compares the current economic situation to previous downturns in U.S. history, specifically referring to the economic cycles following the crashes of 1907 and 1922. This historical context frames the discussion within the American experience of economic hardship.
